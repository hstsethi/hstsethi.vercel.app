<p>Below I present a chronological note of 8 major internet groups I
have singlehandedly founded and led. Along with lessons I learned
from them, screenshots and personal my way of managing them.</p>
<p>Most of my groups were related to, but not limited to,
computers, finance, education. All of them were created with psuedonyms and false identities, without leavraging my achievements. </p>
<p>While this article might be longer than my other articles, I
assure you that it will be comparatively easier to read and I will
be sharing both highs and lows. Reading this article will give you
a wild ride of roller coaster of emotions that will pass through
loop of every emotion.</p>

"Helping a Nigerian member. Me: What? What can I do? N: The virus please it sends large number of messages..."></figure>
<p>After learning programming, cyber security for about 1.5 years,
I at the age of 13, created this group. This was my first internet
group. I got this idea by participating in a similar group. After
creating it, I shared the links in the chatroom and left it, so I
could focus on my own group. Just few hours later, I got lot of
other members, not only from that chatroom but from others too.
After few days I shared this group with some of my classmate and
they joined too. One of the main member was a Nigerian person shown
in screenshot above.</p>
<p>I know the name of this group might look ‚Äúweird‚Äù to some, but to
be honest, not a single member objected. Later I changed it by
omitting my last name for privacy and to reduce my influence.</p>
<p>I also made $13 profit, which was made possible by referring
members of this groups. While I was not able to withdraw it, but
that‚Äôs a different story that I have already explained in my
<a href=
"https://hstsethi.vercel.app/posts/finance/from-coins-to-25-equity-at-18">
financial autobiography</a>.</p>
<p>I left this group because I was kinda worried with my phone
number being associated with such group. Also there were some
people asking about black hat things.</p>
<p>I passed the ownership to one of my classmate and bid farewell.
However, I still kept getting DMs from people even after weeks of
my resignation.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="my-youtube-channel">My YouTube Channel, 14,</h3>
<p>At the age of 14, I started a YouTube channel where I uploaded
unique tech tutorials. I did not share about this channel in my
previous group. I closed it after I got strike on a video where I
taught how to make and execute prank bat "viruses" on Android using
Exagear, Wine implementation for Android, and an another strike for
using copyrighted SFX in my botany video.</p>

<h3 id="telegram-group-telegram-15-150">Telegram Group, Telegram,
15, 150</h3>
<p>‚ÄúTelegram Group‚Äù was the second group I created and it marked
golden age of <del>my leadership</del> this journey.</p>
<p>The reason I say it was the best one because Telegram offered me
global audience, bots, freedom to manage my group as I wanted, all
of things that WhatsApp lacked.</p>
<p>I made extensive use of bots to ease up management. I even
created my own bot! Created an open source wiki and programmed bots
to share relevant extracts on specific triggers. Set rate limit on
messages, blocked certain file types and more.</p>

<p>I made plenty of good friends here, from all over the world, did
collaborations with other groups. Including with a Russian gaming
server, even though <a href=
"https://hstsethi.vercel.app/posts/programming/reasons-i-am-not-gamedeveloper">
I dislike video games</a> and don‚Äôt speak Russian, neither they
spoke English properly, other than just one. I played video games
with them and even defeated them 2-3 times.</p>
<h4 id="leaving-telegram-group-twice">Leaving Telegram Group,
Twice</h4>
<p>As I learned more about internet privacy and security, notice
the No Script extension in first screenshot, I decided to leave the
group and pass admin role to one of the member.</p>
<p>However, he started changing group fundamentals including icon,
description, name. So I <strong>had to cancel my plan of
leaving</strong>, strip him of privileges and ban him.</p>
<p>Emotional messages from some of the group members, first
screenshot of male, second of female, urging me to not leave also
kinda made me to cancel my plan.</p>

promoted two members as admin, left group and deleted Telegram
after few days of announcement.</p>

<h2 id="my-private-web-based-chatroom-15-20">My Private Web Based
Chatroom, 15, 9</h2>
<p>I initially did not want to include this group. But for sake of
completeness and to cheer up readers somewhat, I have decided to
include it.</p>
<p>Just like my Matrix Fanclub described below, this was also a
group of people I knew. Though majority of members were female and
not much tech savvy.</p>
<p>There was a huge platform problem. I refused to create an
Instagram or Snapchat account. Instead, I ‚Äúcreated‚Äù a private, web
based chatroom. It was very minimalist and had no media upload
feature. Hence using Pastebin like sites was encouraged. I managed
to make around 9 people, all female, come there. Male members were
directed to Telegram group.</p>
<p>In the conversation between me and R below, I start by acting
like I forgot her, and ask her identity, if she knows [a nickname
she gave me]. She then said that missed me, asks if I have
Instagram, and if she is the only one who knows about this
chatroom. I then joke her that some ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù, whom I did
collaboration, and hacking group know, they don't. I then also
joked that Instagram banned me twice for trying to "MITM their
server". And also Github, my own platform, is unsafe, only Proton
mail is safe, advised her to refresh webpage after every
message.</p>
<figure><img src=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/my-chat-website-insta-bad-convo-with-r_ilvjpb.jpg"
alt=
"Me: And why are you here(asking politely), who told you about this site? Do you know [a nickname she gave me] R: Ya bro, I know &lt;nickname&gt;. Bro you only said to me about this site. Remember?? Bro I miss you a lot. Me: It was to confirm who are you. Russians also know and my hacking group also know R: K bro. Do you have an Insta id? Can I know plz? Me: No INSTA FB GITHUB [are] Privacy Leech(one in torrent) I only have Proton Github and Telegram. Instagram banned me twice for trying to MITM their server. Github, &lt;my website chatroom&gt; aren't safe now. Proton Mail and Telegram are only option now. me: Ps, always refresh webpage after every message."></figure>
<p>After that she created an Instagram account and gave it to me.
Though still, I did kept joking to her about that I am going to
block her on Instagram, and told her to continue to my website. She
initially, as seen in the screenshot, used to take it seriously but
stopped after adopting my lifestyle, ideology, and also stopped
being insecure of her darker skin tone. She later even started
learning Punjabi, my mother tongue, for me. Despite her native
language being Tamil, a Dravidian language, which is polar opposite
of Punjabi, which belongs to Indo Aryan branch. The genetic
distance between Tamil and Punjabi languages is 78. She learned it
pretty well that a newcomer thought she is Punjaban. Maybe her
excessive use of "bro" played a role in it too.</p>

"Me: I'm blocking u here this app is very confusing to me if u want to contact me then my website is option or else bye forever. I will block after u see this msg. Her: no plz plz do not leave me bro plz plz bro donot block me plz. 10+ crying emojis"></figure>
<figure><img src=

alt=
"R: Im trying to learn Punjabi for u ..xd. few sentence I came to know ..lol. How are you? [Punjabi translation of such]"></figure>
<p>Though sometimes we did really move back to my website. As seen
in below screenshot where I mention, ‚ÄúThis place looks like home‚Äù.
And the she starts her usual ‚Äúromantic drama‚Äù. See alt for extended
chat.</p>
<figure><img src=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/my-website-feels-like-home_1_qbdq55.jpg"
alt=
"Me: Looks like home IDK why. Lol. I don't smoke girl. R: Ur so adorable üòÉ Me: What does that mean. I am illiterate. R: it means [nickname she gave me]. ">

 <p>Once R asked me about my previous relationships on Instagram. When I replied "nothing serious", she did not believe me. I then told her about K, a girl who had slapped me a year earlier, and she got extremely angry and even said that she would travel thousands of kilometers from Tamil Nadu to Punjab just to slap K back. I tried to change topic, but it didn't work. I had never seen her anger before. Eventually I was able to calm R down by saying that her own mother would instead slap her back if she did this, this issue has been solved, and I'm used to it. See full conversation in alt.  Here is the story of K, originally from my  short autobiography, age 14 </p> 
 <blockquote>Just when I thought I was free from drama at school, a new drama erupted near my second home, but I managed to dodge a bullet, as I had few days earlier of it, overheard them praising me, using my nickname. A girl(K), my aged, who was standing with a senior girl(SG), around 3 year older than me, offered me a 10 rupees chocolate, wrapped in an empty notebook paper. She told me, using my nickname, to accept that chocolate and do handshake with K. But when I said, <q>I'm not accepting any chocolate or doing handshake with anyone</q>, SG said, <q>At least say hello, {nickname}</q>. K got angry, slapped me on jawline(aim got wrong) and then ran away immediately, dropping chocolate midway. I didn't do any physical contact with any of them, but SG told me I did wrong because K had done "breakup" with her previous boyfriend friend. SM, who would in future try to mug me, was also present there. Due to this drama, I had to stop going at that place and find a new place, but none of us did any apology. Other than lack of interest, another reason was that K was pretty popular and had an army of simps who would be angry if I had accepted.
 </blockquote>
  <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/r-threatning-k_zpgxqy.jpg" alt="R: Who is that??? How dare she??? Hello?? Who is that?? Me: {Tried to change convo}  R: wht? Me: you know {her alias}? R: No but I just know that if I meet her im gonna salp one on her on face [sic] 
Me(while reacting with a heart emoji to her previous message): Did she also abused u? Then why are you coping so much? Don't worry it's all settled and I'm used to it. R: but bro how did she dare to do that. Me: Your own mother will slap you if you do that." loading="lazy" />
<p>Even though it may look opposite, but I never actually blocked R
or anyone else, I just joked. Here is another conversation between
us on website to clarify that.</p>
<p>"Me: I am blocking you. R: Noo plz plz no. Me: No. R: No. Me:
No No. R: plz bro plz don't. R: Why. R: r u busy bro Me: I did it.
R: Nooo Me: Already done. R: Plz unblock plz. Me: No way. R: what
do you want from me? Me: Nothing. R: Then why are you blocking me?
üòû Me: Wait. R: How much bro. Me: You are sending message coz you
are unblocked. R: üòä Me: Haha plz be smart next time. R: I will do
anything for you bro üòÄ</p>
<p>That‚Äôs pretty much it for R. There were many other members like
‚ÄúU‚Äù, who supported my decision of blocking R, even though I never
blocked her. But TBH, I feel like
U's narrative should have been bigger. It was kinda short in my
personal notes too, I did not even realize how supportive she was
to me, until 4 year later.</p>
<figure><img src=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/u-defending-me-for-blocking-r_necm4s.png"
alt=
"U: Ok bro, But how can she say that abuse her and all. She deserves being blocked. I see why you are blocking her. I think that you are right now ‚ú® THANK YOU!"></figure>

<p>There were others like E who insisted on that I should use Discord, and greet
her, like she does to me, due to which she clashed with R too. P,
R‚Äôs younger sister(same age as me), who randomly jumped into
conversation on my website and would "blackmail" R. A, who was
first female member of chatroom, but still wondered about <q>How
many girls you have</q>. Another one who mass liked all my comments
but when I told her to not waste her time, she said she was doing
deed of friendship and I don't have to return, but I did. But to
keep this section short, I will end it here. </p> <figure><img src=

alt=
"E: Can I tell you something? Me: Tell.E: You should learn to greet people like I greet you nicely. Me: [R] told me. E: And you dont."></figure>

alt="A: Yaar now this girl. How many girls you have lol xd">
<p>Unlike in other groups, I <strong>did not leave a
successor</strong> behind. Because it wouldn't make sense to do so
in here, because the chats were way more individual, many members
had soft rivalry, and no one was influential or tech savvy enough
to manage my website. I was using R's Instagram account, so she was
technically successor, but even she herself deleted both her
accounts, a week after my leave. Another thing, I noticed that was
many others also deleted their accounts, even on other platforms,
after me. E, who I wasn't close with, on just next day. U kept
waiting on website for month, celebrated R departure, because I had
told her I may return.</p>
<p>My reason for leaving was not dispute with any member. In fact,
I <strong>never had dispute with anyone</strong>. But was privacy,
to free up time, focus on Telegram group.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="signal-group-signal-15-6">Signal Group, Signal, 15, 6</h3>
<p>Seeing my previous groups, my classmates said that they also
want to learn programming from me. So I created a private group on
Signal and 6 of them joined.</p>
<p>Though none of them was really interested in programming, and
had weird requests like hacking someone Instagram. Instead of
denying altogether, or guiding them towards their request, I taught
them the process of installing Linux, which I labelled as
perquisite, technically which it is, but even that was too
difficult for them. So instead, I switched to Termux,but even they
couldn't do it either and told me to meet them. I refused and said,
I won't do anything illegal, see alt for translation. So this group
was deleted within a month, and I did not leave a sucessor
behind.</p>

I am only guiding you">
<h3 id="earlier-matrix-group-matrix">Earlier Matrix Group, Matrix, 16, 4</h3>
<p>I created this group at the age of 16, jshortly afterwards my exams were over and my high school has began. I had just learned about the Matrix protocol, and my purpose was to discuss my <a href="https://gist.github.com/hstsethi/181d1bca68ac8220e390e0ea76396144"><cite> is Tor safe? 26+ reasons(with citations) which proves that it isn't.</cite></a> article, which I had published just 3 days after my grade 10 exams were over, 4 days before high school began, and general privacy setup. </p>

<p>I had no intention to create a group, as I was more busy in real life socilizations. The only reason I did was because I was banned from a tech community formy privacy views, for which they considered me that I am paranoid and need mental health suppport. That is why this group was not included in earlier versions of this article, but the only reason I am doing now is because this was a foundational event for my age 17 Fanclub creation.</p>
<p>So after I was banned from the tech community, I created a small, private group which was joined by 3 other members from that group. Out of which, C, was most enthusiastic about group, but she did not knew much about technology, as evident by her asking, but at least she was curious to learn. They other two just wanted to debate more on my Tor article. </p>

<p>Below is a screenshot when the topic changed to GPG. Where I, referred to as X in alt, was in favor of GPG, password store password manager, and against Bitwarden, being an ex-user of it myself. A was pro Bitwarden and found GPG to be overkill, and also suggested me to not use Matrix. C also jumped in confused, asking what am I try to argue abou.Then tagged me, asking what is GPG. </p>

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/earlier-matrix-my-man_fdy2mb.png" alt="A: dude, is anything besides gpg safe enough for you? if your threat model is so high maybe you shouldn't even use
matrix lol. C: What is my man trying to argue
about? C: @X What are you arguing
about?
X: I think Matrix is safe. It does not require phone number and accepts alias email. 
X(in response to C): GPG
C: What is it?
X: Encryption tool
C: Okay so what about GPG?
X: It was about password managers. Why don't you read the chat log."  />

<p>A day later followed another conversation on torrents, magnet links. C again jumped in to ask questions. This time another member, B, was also there, who was kinda dismissing. </p>
<p>C: What is a torrent? A: Complex thing B: Nothing you need to worry about. C: @X, what is torrent and magnet link. X: It's just a way to share files like Gdrive but without third parties. B: That's wrong. X: Okay that does not matter. What matters is torrenting over Tor is not safe. A: Many nodes block torrrenting for this reason. C: Why isn't it safe? X: Because I say so, lmao. It's literally given in my article. B: I2P allows it.  </p>

<p>Within a two week, I closed the group without appointing a sucessor, deleted my Matrix account. We had understood that we can never reach a consenus. We engaged in some philosophical, abstract discussions, but I, and following me C, preferred to solve real life problems instead. </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="fanclub-matrix-17-200">Fanclub, Matrix, 17, 200</h3>
<p>Unlike my other groups, this one was different. It was not
composed just of random Internet strangers, but somewhat familiar
internet people.</p>
<p>Members were very diverse from areas including Americas, Central
Asia, China, Southern Europe. Though there were only 3 members from
Indian subcontinent and only one, I, was active participant.</p>
<p>Diversity was not just limited to nations, there were all kind
of genders, languages here. For example, one of a main member and
future moderator, T, was a trans woman and also a refugee from rival then turned friendly room. Another main member and future moderator, A, was a ex
muslim, gay communist. Despite me being none of those minorities. Additionally, there was no main purpose of
this group, which can explain the high message count.</p>
<p>I created this group after I built up enough audience by talking
in other groups, including X, It was intended to be a satire, not
serious, hence it was initially named ‚Äú&lt;my username&gt; fanclub‚Äù
and was private. I did not even share a link. I just said ‚ÄúYou
should join my fanclub for fun.‚Äù</p>
<p>However to my surprise, it grew rapidly. On just <strong>first
day it got around 400 messages</strong>. This made me serious and I
temporarily made this group public, invited lot of other
people.</p>
<p>Two months passed by but the group didn‚Äôt stop growing and
encryption started lagging. So I had to send an
<code>m.room.tombstone</code> event to this one and create another
unencrypted group on another home server.</p>
<p>Shortly after creating a public group, I discovered an abandoned
anime roleplay chatroom with no active moderators. I managed to
revive it by criticizing anime, and later by ‚Äúacting‚Äù as a
moderator of the group, promoting my ideology, encouraging members
to move to my group. Soon they all shifted to my group. That also
improved the gender ratio of my group, because the majority of
members there were females, or at least they claimed to be.</p>
<p>However even after settling in my group, they did continue their
roleplay thing though to a less extent, and even involved me as "Supreme Leader", despite me telling them to not use it as it sounds fascist. Here is an example. X is a placeholder for my
username, P, Q both are from roleplay room.</p>
<pre><code> - P: Supreme Leader is angry at me
 - Q: is he?
 - P: Q, tell X that P left the room
 - P: He can't see me [She thought that I have blocked her]
 - Q: okay i gotchu

<p>Below is an example of an average day in that group. We were
discussing a C++ algorithm but B posted the
benchmark done on Microsoft Windows. Seeing it was done on Windows,
we started bantering with B. Saying that opinion of a Windows
user is invalid.</p>

<h4>Empirical Study To Measure Influence</h4>
<p>I even conducted a public, empirical study to measure the
influence of selected members(n = 5) of Fanclub. My hypothesis
were: I will have the most influence. The more the influence, the
more the words will be repeated, through both replies and
adoption.</p>
<p>I exported chat logs(n = 8,000) as plain text. With consensus of
all participants created sets of signature, unique, words, phrases.
Below is an excerpt from the set:</p>
<pre>
<code class="lang-json">
    {"my_words": ["nice bait", "meds", "grp_nck_unity", "grp_nck_freedom", "not debating that", "for fun"],
    "a_words": ["gulag",  "grp_nck_communism"],
    "t_words": ["omg", "seethe", "purr"]}
</code>
</pre>
<p>A designed a simple shell script using Jq, grep. I implemented
bash arrays instead of looping JSON with Jq. I also wished to write
it in C++ with B, as I was in my C++ phase then and it would be
fun, but I didn't citing that it would take lot of time. I then
counted how many times these words were used.</p>
<p>The results fulfilled both hypothesis. After me, A had most
influence. T results were not as impressive because she didn't talk
much with other members than me, and was not there for long when
the data was collected. Other 2 members didn't seem to show much
influence. Notably, B use of common words and using Windows might
have contributed to it.</p>
<p>Other than showing objective metrics of influence, this study
paved the way for other members to conduct more study. Which even
made me create a sperate room which served as a "journal" for
studies. The requirements to get published there was just to use
the Markdown template provided, and add some metadata.</p>

<h4 id="problems-in-moderation-and-leave">Problems In Moderation
And Leave</h4>
<p>As group started growing even more, it started getting harder to
moderate it. It regularly got raided by spammers who spammed NSFW
media, malware and more. Since Matrix did not have much public
bots, unlike Telegram, this became even more challenging. While
there was an API, but to get most of it you had to host a home
server yourself. I did create some scripts using client API, some
of them are available on my <a href=
"https://github.com/hstsethi/matrix-scripts">Github</a> too.</p>
<p>So I appointed a moderator. But unfortunately, he did not do any
good job. Literally every thing had to be deleted by me, he instead deleted unrelated messages. I silently
dismissed him as a moderator, but he didn't realize it till 6 days.
When he asked me for reason, I made announcement stressing on his
far right political ideology and my desire to keep mod team small.
So I came up with idea of marking group private before going
offline and making it public back when I came. I also reported
these incidents to home server admins, who helped me by deleting
their accounts, messages.</p>
<p>Another method I came up with to replace the previous method was
as follows: set the default power value 0; set the minimum power
value to send message as 3 to react as 0. Set the value of all
trusted members to 5. Non trusted members to 4. I used client
server API for this as I didn't have home server. Changing the
value of individual members was required because without that, the
members value would be whatever the defualt value variable is.
After it was done, all new members were able to react(send
m.reaction event), but they couldn't send message, until they were
assigned power value of higher than 3.</p>
<p>my another reason for leaving was that an ex classmate(EC from C-1), also a bad debtor, to whom
i introduced matrix platform, somehow discovered x group,<strong> but not my Fanclub, ever.</strong> he recognized me there and started behaving like he was
familiar with me. members there immediately started being
suspicious of us. i was worried that he might dox me, which he has
history of, or if his opsec gets comprised, it will compromise mine
too. my another concern was his growing extremism after he combined far right propaganda with knowledge of evolutionary biology from me around 3 months ago. That was meant to debunk casteism but he twisted, which no other classmate had done. So just around hour later, i secretly got him banned from X
group from the hands of my moderator friend. i did not tell him to ban he himself said <q>i can ban him if you want. i don't give a f...</q>. i then just thanked him and he actually did. </p>
<p>around a month later, ec met another moderator of x group in a hate group(hg) who not only unbanned him but also spilled the
beans. hearing that, he also doxed my personal information to him.
i‚Äôm not sure till what extent he did in dms, but as i saw chat logs
of HG, he surely did enough. i had created an alt
afterwards but still some users, including the members of my Fanclub,
were aware of it, but not the reason of such. around just 20 days later, ec was banned from hg for not fitting their racial criteria, which he cried about to me, but he was on ignore list.</p>

<p>8 months later, he got himself unblocked by me, on Whatsapp as I had left Matrix by then. i did it out of respect, because he complained to my father that i blocked him, but did not reveal any story. though around a month later, he again got banned due to his weird behavior, pushing his gossips, far right, self hating political ideology.  also his behavior of calling at my home is extremely childish. i don't even have his home numbers. i blocked him on my father's phone too.  </p> 
<p>So after 3 months of that dox event, I started sharing my
thoughts of leaving the group and appointed two more moderators.
They were really sad and some of them left immediately after I
left, one of my close friend deleted his account too.</p>
<p>A day later, I came back from an alt account. I replied to one
of the mod, T, and she was shocked that I have not blocked her. I
replied with one of a my signature phrase ‚Äúnice bait‚Äù. I then told
mods that to prepare a list. T replied that all members left after
my announcement, but I encouraged them that I will stay here for
just for them, and even reclaim my throne as "Supreme Leader" and they got bit happy, see screenshot below.</p>

T: üòä A: welcome back comrade Me: Thank you comrade. But I feel like nobody is smart enough to take my throne.

Me: I haven't taken any yet." /> </figure>
<p>Later when I did not return after 7 days, the group died, some
more members left and told mods to invite them when I come
back.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs it for this group. Though there are plenty of more things
that I can cover, because it was the longest running group after
all, but it‚Äôs already going very long.</p>

<h3 id="academic-chatroom-reddit-17-13">Academic Chatroom, Reddit, 17, 13</h3>

<p>Initially I did not want to include this, because Reddit content such as posts, comments, is public and easily accessible even post deletion of creator's account. Though, after 6 months of writing this autobiography, I have decided to include it. I will only be sharing screenshots of private chats to serve as &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>
<p>Shortly after leaving my Matrix Fanclub, at age 17.5, I stumbled across a study material on Reddit. I created a Reddit account, with a pseudonym, messaged him to obtain it. I was thankful to him for providing me the raw scans, and even helped him by sharing my knowledge about stock market, technology, career, and letting him join Group-A. But it was in horrible condition and was around 50mb. The material wasn't also much useful to me during exams, and I preferred my own physical textbook, but it quenched my curiosity. But it helped others, and that's great because not everyone can afford expensive textbooks.</p>
<p>I ran it through OCR, trimmed it, broke it down into volumes, gray scaled, and compressed it to total size of <strong>just 18mb</strong>. I released the final version to public and it gained lot of supports, but some were still complaining that link isn't working, but it was but they just didn't see it as it was a direct download link. I started getting lot of chat requests on how I did it, and requests for additional resources. To deal with so many messages, I created a temporary chatroom(Group-A) for it. It gained around 13 members. I also shared some resources, scripts used in it, but members weren't able to use script due to it being tailored for Linux.</p>
<p>A member(P) from Group-A who wasn't able to fill his post graduate exam form because he was unable to properly convert and resize the required documents, despite claiming to try for a week. So instead, he shared those private documents including his Aadhar card, signature, mugshot with me to process. Despite being around 6 year older than me, he  described himself as my &quot;little brother&quot;. I ended up helping him, at 21:00 with my mobile and Image Magick, and he was too extremely grateful to me, and slightly insecure in himself. See screenshot and alt below for transcription.</p>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/v1742794615/reddit-chatroom-help-doc-conv_hzwdax.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="
          P: Hello, bro I wanted to have my images converted for form. I will be very grateful if you can help your little brother out
          Me: Sure post
          Me(after posting converted): Hmm did it work then?
          P: BROTHER it worked I have been wasting my brain for it since a week but today it finally went through. Bro can you format this picture as well? It is required along with of signature. 
          Me: Okay post
          P: Thank you so much bro. How old are you??
          Me: 17
          P: Wow bro 17 year old and already this.I feel insecure
          Me: Don't worry. Everybody has their own merits" />

<p>Due to Reddit chats being extremely glitchy, lack of proper moderation tools, I created another group on Matrix. It was joined by 3 people from Group-A, including P, but I had accidentally forgot about it, because I was focusing on my fans. And due to it's more technical nature, it didn't succeed.</p>
<p>I ended up closing both groups, without leaving a successor, within a month to focus on other things, but not studies. My another reason to leave was a clash of ideologies and view points. Whereas, I don't care much of academics, because I don't think so that success can be achieved without deviating the norm, but they were very studios. I didn't victimize myself, but they kept saying how they were forced into this &quot;rat race&quot;. While I didn't share my complete story with them, but I also faced more social pressure because I was favorite student of multiple teachers. See age 15 in Short Autobiography). Some of them also had a delusion that they were superior to me because they were in STEM and I was in commerce, but I didn't care enough to share my achievements. But my Matrix account remained for a while and I kept getting messages there.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I had gathered a group of around <strong>4 fans</strong>, actually jealous men who were all older than me. They were never allowed into Group-A. One of most obsessed fan had said to my leave announcement, &quot;Don't worry Sir, I will keep following you. You will always have a fan no matter what&quot;.  Despite the mass down votes, I had also gathered more than 1,000 Karma.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="previous-college-group-whatsapp-18-11">Previous College
Group, WhatsApp, 18, 11</h3>
<p>I was invited to an unofficial group before the start of
college. I noticed that people there were way older and they
weren't interested in studies, but were openly doing drugs(alcohol,
cannabis, hookah), insulting female members, making gangs, planning
fights etc. There was also a language barrier with them speaking
regional dialect while discouraging my usage of English, the common
language.</p>
<p>In the conversation below, after first day, I ask them a
question that if the place in video video they uploaded is our
college, but they tell dismiss my question by telling me to smoke
and sleep, even though I never talked about any drug there. See
Translation in alt.</p>
<img src=

alt=
"Me: Is this our college? A: You go smoke and sleep ü§£. B: Wow üòÇ B: ü§£ ü§°">
<p>So I started my own group with same principles as of my previous
groups. Advertised it as a safe space for serious studies and chit
chat. I got joined by <strong>11 members</strong>. The female
members were expressing gratitude to me for creating a group where
they wouldn't be insulted due to their skin color or accent.</p>
<p>The admins of the unofficial group were happy that I took
serious students out of their group, so they could continue their
activities more freely.</p>
<p>This group stayed there for few days until I went to my first
day of college, technically the second day, and noticed the bad
environment there.</p>
<p>The students were as I expected. Classroom were extremely dirty,
crammed with around 90 students in ours. Teachers spoke local
dialect and weren't very knowledgeable. One could not even
pronounce "environment" correctly. There were no restrooms on our
floor. Library was out of stock on almost everything. A group of
unknown boys gathered near my seat. First they wondered that where
I came from. I replied that I am Punjabi with a random village
name, which doesn't even exist. They asked me how I'm so pale, if I
hear Punjabi songs, which I replied no. I didn't tell them I was
the one who created the unofficial group. One of them invited me to
his bench, I denied it at first but later went.</p>
<p>When classes started, they couldn't even answer basic questions
like full form of PCB, difference between direct and alternating
current. I anonymously answered "Printed Circiut Board" and they,
including teachers, got so shocked that who answered it. A person
from group who earlier talked to me shouted, in a overexcited
voice, <q>That black shirt Punjabi</q> while pointing towards me. I
then raised my hand, stood up, while giggling for a second, which
turned contiguous. Teacher asked me about my background and he was
also shocked when I said I came from non science background. I
didn't reveal my programming background either. Then that held a 5
seconds clapping session for me. After the college ended and some
people still congratulated me, joked, with 2 members from my group
who found me and didn't even ask for confirmation. One offered to
drop me, but I refused.</p>
<p>After that, I planned to leave the college itself. I saw that
few people of my group were wondering if that was me, but I didn't
respond. Earlier I had told them that I will come this day and they
<q>will recognize me upon seeing.</q> I went back to my home the
next day early morning, without eating anything or telling to
landlady that I'm going forever, because I did not want to stress
her. After reaching home, I called her husband and told him that I
have left the college and will vacate his room on Sunday. The rent
was already paid in advance so there were no issues. Another
interesting thing I noticed, in a random video uploaded in group,
that at least 5 other males, who were sitting nearby me, 2 females
copied my black shirt, one did my metallic silver wrist watch. And
few others were sending Punjabi songs in their original unofficial
group. Despite teacher <strong>explicly announcing</strong>, on day
1 and repeating on day 2, that only white or navy shirt be wore,
with white shoes until uniform is issued. And black is often
considered taboo to be worn on beginning of important events. I was
flattered that how I got so influential, even in such random
decision, but still it didn't convince me to stay.</p>
<p>There were many other positive experiences such as a bus driver
stopped midway just for me, when I was leaving and waiting for tuk
tuk, and the conductor chatted me the whole journey, despite me not
understanding his language. A middle aged, overweight, woman who
got influenced by my unsweetened peanut butter choice. She asked me
if it helps in weight loss, how to consume it and if it is tasty. I
said that I only eat it because I want to gain weight. It can be
connsumed with bread, roti, or milk, but I eat it raw, even though
it's not "tasty". Though she still bought 1Kg of it, same quantity
as me. Another old man who strangely came directly to me, from a
queue, to get his keypad phone fixed, which automatically got fixed
when I reinserted the battery and turned of Bluetooth. But that
weren't reasons to stay.</p>
<p>My decision to leave was more complex than that. There were many
other issues: staring; in place of living; language barrier; Hookah
culture; education quality.</p>
<p>After few days of it, I revealed to them that it was me, who
answered the questions, as they were wondering, and I left the
group without leaving any successor behind.</p>
<p>I still got direct messages from some members who said they want
to learn from me. As below conversation shows, one female member
requesting my help, but soon I blocked her to focus on finding a
good college, excluding the 120+ list of colleges I had made.</p>

<p>Few days later, on Sunday, I came back, with my father,
collected all my belongings, got my documents from college and left
forever.</p>
<p>Hopefully there was still time left and I was able to enroll
myself into an open university and create another group,
Freedomphiles, on first day of college, which is described
below.</p>

alt="Screenshot of Programmers of VGU"></figure>
<p>I was the first one to realize the importance of having an
unofficial chat group and to create such. I created this group on
very first day of my college.</p>
<p>Following me, many other created groups, but the reason they did
not succeed much because they were not as tech savvy as me, all of
them created specialization specific groups, and lack of
freedom.</p>
<p>I promoted the fact that we all will be following same syllabus
till first year and managed to unite several other unofficial
groups under my community.</p>
<h4 id="spies-in-the-official-group">Spies In The Official
Group</h4>
<p>Just the next day I realized that there were few members among
us who were connected to authorities of the college.</p>
<p>I deduced it by seeing their profile picture, where they looked
older than average first year students, their behavior, attempts to
help students, maintain discipline. The next day, they were
promoted to admins which confirmed by suspicion even more. Also one
such spy admitted being 23.</p>
<p>I added a note in description of my groups that whoever who is
connected to college authorities will be banned on the spot. A week
later, I banned two of them from my group, after failed questioning
with them and an announcement, see screenshot below.</p>
<figure><img src=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/freedomphiles-announcement-spies-kicked_apk7hg.jpg"
             alt="Me(As community admin): To Everyone: Like I have been suspecting since first day about {names of two spies}. It was proven to be true now. I always felt like they were connected to college authorities. So it's now clear. See both are admins... For that reason, they are permanently banned from this community. Feel free to talk and enjoy freedom!"></figure>
<p>As you can see in screenshot below, I questioned him politely,
after fulfilling his request of a code review. I also trapped him
an accusation ‚ÄúIf you are not connected with authorities then why
are you admin? And why is your surname same as of the
ex-admin‚Äù.</p>

alt="Screenshot of questioning with one of such spy"></figure>
<p>Later I also discovered few other ways including asking for
screenshot of their Learning Management System(LMS) and tallying it
with students list which was hidden in LMS. Below is the screenshot
of a female spy who messaged me first but next day, I managed to
make her send me her LMS screenshot which proved to me that she was
in last year, so I had to ban and block her‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Translation of chat: ‚ÄúHer: Proud of you. Let me free you of one

Thank you. Me: Hmm Thanks lol‚Äù</p>
<h4 id="kickout-from-the-official-group">Kickout From The
‚ÄúOfficial‚Äù Group</h4>
<p>Around 1.5 month later from the above event, I was kicked out
from the official group for pointing out errors in study material
along with screenshots and code example to support my claim. Seeing
this, four members from my group raised their voice against it and
<strong>they were kicked out too.</strong>, see transcription and
context in alt.</p>

"A(Before kick): Why did you kick Sethi‚Ä¶ otherwise who isn‚Äôt familiar with CS would get wrong information. A(When referencing kickout screenshot): As I told [you]. They removed me too Me: Oh welcome to the club. It‚Äôs a sign of bravery. B: Still I‚Äôm not removed. A, C: (Reacts with ü§£ to my message.) B: Wait Let me drop a banger. üí£ D: They kicked me out too.">
Me: Welcome welcome to the club. B: I am gone too ü§£ C: Gone for
good üòπ Me: Haha, we are not going to stop at this. They can kick us
but this has already sparked the flame. E: Should I say something
too? Me: No you are our last hope for information. Don‚Äôt say
anything yet. Also don‚Äôt damage your image of studios student lol.
E: I will stay in group B: Knowledge is power ü§ì
<p>E then provided us detailed screenshots of chats, post our ban.
Thanks to him. The second member to get kicked, C, was also able to
get information from another source. Though even if they both got
banned, I had plenty of other sources.</p>
<p>After analyzing post kick screenshots, I saw that many members
were surprised who was kicked. But they didn‚Äôt say it directly.
They said, ‚ÄúThe one who pointed out errors‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe one who was
talking about getting a job offer at Microsoft‚Äù. There were no
mentions of other martyrs which made me upset and I told E to share
that other 4 male members, along with their names, of Freedomphiles
were kicked too.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, one female member thought there were two people
who pointed out errors: one male and other female, who was
described as ‚Äúbehaves like she knows everything‚Äù, which is to be
honest more the description of me. One member of my group tried
correcting her that there was only one male, but she still
insisted. She added that the member should try talking to her.
What‚Äôs even more surprising that she was the one who firstly
messaged me, two months before kick, used affectionate language,
like she would with a male, and shared me notes, without me asking.
I didn‚Äôt correct her, because I was not talking to her as I was
busy.</p>
<p>Just few days later I observed that the group members who were
kicked out seemed very nonchalant and they refused to email higher
authorities regarding this. They were nonchalant on other issues
and the ones that will happen in future too.</p>
<p>Around two weeks later, I discovered that the <strong>group was
somehow unofficial.</strong> There was only an official community
with teachers who we were familiar with. The university also
repeatedly warned against unofficial groups saying they only had
this community group, nothing else.</p>
<p>Though I refuse to believe that it was unofficial all the way as
we got link of it through email. Maybe they took it‚Äôs authority
later on.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="leaving-and-passing-ownership">Leaving And Passing
Ownership</h4>
<p>I left this group because it felt like an unnecessary
responsibility and talking to a wall. I could not express myself
freely. I had to ‚Äúdumb down‚Äù ideas because I was the only tech
savvy person or active person here, others were not even willing to
learn. I was the only one raising voice against the university,
finding errors in study material. Like in many more cases which I
have not mentioned here.</p>
<p>I passed the ownership to one of the member who later left
himself and passed to another one.</p>
<p>Though still, I continued to speak against wrong things, help others in official college group. Below
is an example of me being the <strong>first one in folllowing cases:</strong>to complete all of my first semester exams; announce the results are declared; discrepancies in them; help students in it. For the screenshots, and other related evidences, see this <a href="https://gist.github.com/hstsethi/be010e0d9e8a24b2b149bc8a77f1a1a5">Gist</a> </p>
<p>"Me: I have found the result. Is it final or will there be any changes? Because I noticed a discrepancy in my elective.
S: Result is declared?
Me: Yes
D: Where did you find it?
Me: Just go to Copilot site and then there is grading section in hamburger menu.
Me: But another discrepancy is: there are total 7 subjects. 5 of them credit of 4. And rest two have 2. So that means 5*4 + 2*2 = 24 but total credit points earned is given as 182 to me.
S: Same
Me: So you also got 182? I have managed to deduce how SGPA is calculated. I have decided to not create a script for that as it's such a common thing and I already have one on Github for mean, SD time calculation.

I am not sure from where did they pull the 182 from. I examined another homogeneous report card with all A, which means 8, and it's 192 there. 

So I would like to analyze some more. Can you send me a censored copy of yours?

The results haven't been officially declared yet, despite it has been a day since I first  announced it. So that's why I have not messaged college authorities regarding it." </p>

<p>‚ÄúThe members of the group don‚Äôt talk to each other. The

silencing dissent, isolation, or even "harmless* approaches like
micro managing, manipulation.</p>
<p>Learning from my observations, I started encouraging
participation through daily programming, doubt solving , memes and
chit-chat threads, weekly non-fiction literature reading threads.
Encouraged posting news, science articles.</p>
<p>I could also take a coercive approach and ban inactive people,
ban links to other groups, force members of Freedomphiles to speak
against my kick out, errors in study material from official group
else get banned or guilt trip them, but I didn't.</p>
<p>However, it's not to say that influence is totally useless.
Because if we look at my fanclub example again, I was able to
gather lot of members just with a phrase <q>You should Join My
fanclub for fun</q></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="importance-of-freedom">Importance Of Freedom</h3>
<p>From start, I have allowed plenty of freedom to members both in
main group and by creating an off topic group.</p>
<p>My groups also had a rule which prohibited ‚Äúrestricting freedom
of speech of others‚Äù, which was strictly enforced.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="maintaining-a-clear-set-of-rules-punishments-awards">
Maintaining A Clear Set of Rules, Punishments, Awards</h3>
<p>As I mentioned above, my groups were very free. However some
things were restricted. I had create set of rules what was
prohibited and how do I define that.</p>
<p>The restricted things included: pornography, gore, restricting
freedom of speech of other, promoting commercial products or
services.</p>
<p>There was a clear hierarchy of ‚Äúpunishments‚Äù and awards. Which
ranged from 1 minute mute, mass social rejection(in form of blocks
by members), to permanent ban. Though they were not necessarily
punishments. As some people voluntarily requested mutes if the
group was too addictive or distracting for them.</p>
<p>There was a system of appeals. Offenders could debate it in
Janny Chat, and appeal by writing an essay acknowledging why were
they banned, what rule they broke, and how would they act in
future</p>
<p>Awards included badges, on platforms which support those,
exclusive access to certain groups, leaderboard and more. Some
members though ‚Äúflexed‚Äù their status of having a high message
count, and being an older member to newcomers but it was all
playful banter.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="using-bots-and-automation-to-ease-up-management">Using Bots
And Automation To Ease Up Management</h3>
<p>Bots proved to be really useful and they are what made Telegram
group so successful. I really missed them on WhatsApp and Matrix.
But more on Matrix as it had a bigger spam problem and it was
ironic that an open source social media standard did not any bot
community.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="importance-of-being-a-sole-leader">Importance of Being A
Sole Leader</h3>
<p>Being a moderator is not an easy task. An ideal mod would have
knowledge of local languages, tech savvy, respect for freedom,
would not get triggered by insults, explict or shock content.</p>
<p>An ideal mod would also not block users. Because by blocking
users, the mod is basically giving the chance to blocked users to
break rules and go unnoticed. This is why I never blocked anyone. I
admit that I did ignore many, but didn't block anyone.</p>
<p>Since all of the members were random internet strangers, giving
them power to irreversibly destroy a group did not look like a fair
deal to me.</p>
<p>Even if I had given power to some member, which I did at time of
leaving by appointing successors, it would be unfair to others one.
Because it would be all my subjective opinion and I might get
accused of favoritism.</p>
<p>Thirdly, as you might have noticed above, they were in the group
because of me. They did not connect with anyone else. They left
when I left. So appointing a leader to which members did not
connect would be wrong too.</p>
<p>Fourthly, The empirical study conducted in <a href=
"#empirical-study-influence">Fanclub</a> proved that I had highest
influence. The fact that none of the groups flourished after I
left, even though I had appointed leaders, is an another empirical
evidence for my claim.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean there was complete "fascism" in my
groups, because I am myself against fascism and have taken action many time against it. In fact, I encouraged the members to participate in legal
matters of groups by holding regular polls, and having a seperate
chatroom named "Janny Chat" for anyone who wants to talk to me and
mods.</p>
<h3 id="importance-own-groups">Importance Of Creating Own
Group</h3>
<p>A person asked me why did I create my own groups instead of
participating in other's group. Well there are lot of reasons for
that, such as lack of freedom, unfamiliarity, but the biggest
reason is moderators.</p>
<p>In almost all groups I have been banned from, I was banned
because the moderators saw me as a threat to their influence. After
all, the true leader is one who has influence. And who likes
getting their power getting snatched.</p>
<p>They didn't like how an outsider is leading conversations,
influencing members to vote against his ban in polls etc. In some
cases, even mods themselves have disputes on whether to ban me or
not. As one of the mod unbanned me and invited me again, but I
refused citing that I have created my own group.</p>
<p>However mods do not know that these bans do not do anything,
other than temporarily reliving their insecurity. Because majority
of groups do not have any USP, and bans are easy to evade. In many
cases, like T in my fanclub, people who supported me have willingly
left the group to join mine, and some of the groups I have created
were result of ban.</p>
<p>If we look at above example, you can see that my influence was
growing, students were reporting errors in study material,
challenging authority. So the moderators bannned me along with 4
others who supported me.</p>
