<p>Below I present a chronological note of major internet groups I
have singlehandedly founded and led. Along with lessons I learned
from them, screenshots and personal my way of managing them.</p>
<p>Most of my groups were related to, but not limited to,
computers, finance, education.</p>
<p>While this article might be longer than my other articles, I
assure you that it will be comparatively easier to read and I will
be sharing both highs and lows. Reading this article will give you
a wild ride of roller coaster of emotions that will pass through
loop of every emotion.</p>

</figure>
<p>After learning programming, cyber security for about 1.5 years,
I at the age of 13, created this group. This was my first internet
group. I got this idea by participating in a similar group. After
creating it, I shared the links in the chatroom and left it, so I
could focus on my own group. Just few hours later, I got lot of
other members, not only from that chatroom but from others too.
After few days I shared this group with some of my classmate and
 they joined too. One of the main member was a Nigerian person shown in screenshot above.</p>
<p>I know the name of this group might look ‚Äúweird‚Äù to some, but to
be honest, not a single member objected. Later I changed it by
omitting my last name for privacy and to reduce my influence.</p>
<p>I left this group because I was kinda worried with my phone
number being associated with such group. Also there were some
people asking about black hat things.</p>
<p>I passed the ownership to one of my classmate and bid farewell.
However, I still kept getting DMs from people even after weeks of
my resignation.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="my-youtube-channel">My YouTube Channel, 14, </h3>
<p>At the age of 14, I started a YouTube channel where I uploaded unique tech tutorials. I did not share about this channel in my previous group.
I closed it after I got strike on a video where I taught how to make and execute prank bat "viruses" on Android using Exagear, Wine implementation for Android, and an another strike for using copyrighted SFX in my botany video. </p>

<h3 id="telegram-group-telegram-15-150">Telegram Group, Telegram, 15, 150</h3>
<p>‚ÄúTelegram Group‚Äù was the second group I created and it marked golden age of <del>my
leadership</del> this journey.</p>
<p>The reason I say it was the best one because Telegram offered me
global audience, bots, freedom to manage my group as I wanted, all
of things that WhatsApp lacked.</p>
<p>I made extensive use of bots to ease up management. I even
created my own bot! Created an open source wiki and programmed bots
to share relevant extracts on specific triggers. Set rate limit on
messages, blocked certain file types and more.</p>

</figure>
<p>I made plenty of good friends here, from all over the world, did
collaborations with other groups. Including with a Russian gaming
server, even though <a href=
"https://hstsethi.vercel.app/posts/programming/reasons-i-am-not-gamedeveloper">
I dislike video games</a> and don‚Äôt speak Russian, neither they spoke English properly, other than just one. I played video games with them and even defeated them 2-3 times.</p>
<p>I also made $13 profit, which was made possible by referring
members of this groups. While I was not able to withdraw it, but
that‚Äôs a different story that I have already explained in my
<a href=

financial autobiography</a>.</p>
<h4 id="leaving-telegram-group-twice">Leaving Telegram Group, Twice</h4>
<p>As I learned more about internet privacy and security, notice
the No Script extension in first screenshot, I decided to leave the
group and pass admin role to one of the member.</p>
<p>However, he started changing group fundamentals including icon,
description, name. So I <strong>had to cancel my plan of
leaving</strong>, strip him of privileges and ban him.</p>
<p>Emotional messages from some of the group members, urging me to
not leave also kinda made me to cancel my plan.</p>

<h2 id="my-private-web-based-chatroom-16-20">My Private Web Based
Chatroom, 15, 9</h2>
<p>I initially did not want to include this group. But for sake of
completeness and to cheer up readers somewhat, I have decided to
include it.</p>
<p>Just like my Matrix Fanclub described below, this was also a
group of people I knew. Though majority of members were female and
not much tech savvy.</p>
<p>There was a huge platform problem. I refused to create an
Instagram or Snapchat account. Instead, I ‚Äúcreated‚Äù a private, web
based chatroom. It was very minimalist and had no media upload feature. Hence using Pastebin like sites was encouraged. I managed to make around 9 people, all female, come there. Male members were directed to Telegram group.</p>
<p>In the conversation between me and R below, I start by acting
like I forgot her, and ask her identity, if she knows [a nickname she gave me]. She then said that missed
me, asks if I have Instagram, and if she is the only one who knows
about this chatroom. I then joke her that some ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù, whom I
did collaboration, and hacking group know, they don't. I then also joked that Instagram banned me
twice for trying to "MITM their server". And also Github, my own platform, is
unsafe, only Proton mail is safe, advised her to refresh webpage
after every message.</p>
<figure><img src=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/my-chat-website-insta-bad-convo-with-r_ilvjpb.jpg"
alt="Me: And why are you here(asking politely), who told you about this site? Do you know [a nickname she gave me]
R: Ya bro, I know <nickname>. Bro you only said to me about this site. Remember?? Bro I miss you a lot.
Me: It was to confirm who are you. Russians also know and my hacking group also know
R: K bro. Do you have an Insta id? Can  I know plz?
Me: No INSTA FB GITHUB [are] Privacy Leech(one in torrent) I only have Proton Github and Telegram. Instagram banned me twice for trying to MITM their server. Github, <my website chatroom> aren't safe now. Proton Mail and Telegram are only option now.
me: Ps, always refresh webpage after every message.">
</figure>
<p>After that she created an Instagram account and gave it to me.
Though still, I did kept joking to her about that I am going to
block her on Instagram, and told her to continue to my website. She
initially, as seen in the screenshot, used to take it seriously but stopped
after adopting my lifestyle, ideology, and also stopped being insecure of her darker skin tone. She later even started learning Punjabi,
my mother tongue, for me. Despite her native
language being Tamil, a Dravidian language, which is polar opposite
of Punjabi, which belongs to Indo Aryan branch. The genetic
distance between Tamil and Punjabi languages is 78. She learned it pretty well that a newcomer thought she is Punjaban. Maybe her excessive use of "bro" played a role in it too. </p>

</figure>
<figure><img src=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/r-learning-punjabi-for-me_wtcp5h.jpg"
alt="R: Im trying to learn Punjabi for u ..xd. few sentence I came to know ..lol. How are you? [Punjabi translation of such]">
</figure>
<p>Though sometimes we did really move back to my website. As seen
in below screenshot where I mention, ‚ÄúThis place looks like home‚Äù.
And the she starts her usual ‚Äúromantic drama‚Äù. See alt for extended chat.</p>
<figure><img src=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/my-website-feels-like-home_1_qbdq55.jpg"
alt="Me: Looks like home IDK why. Lol. I don't smoke girl. R: Ur so adorable üòÉ Me: What does that mean. I am illiterate. R: it means [nickname she gave me]. ">

<p>Even though it may look opposite, but I never actually blocked R or anyone else, I just joked. Here is another conversation between us on website to clarify that. </p>
<p>"Me: I am blocking you. R: Noo plz plz no. Me: No. Her: No. Me: No No. R: plz bro plz don't. R: Why. R: r u busy bro Me: I did it. R: Nooo
Me: Already done.  R: Plz unblock plz. Me: No way. R: what do you want from me? Me: Nothing. R: Then why are you blocking me? üòû Me: Wait. R:  How much bro. Me: You are sending message coz you are unblocked. R: üòä
Me: Haha plz be smart next time. R: I will do anything for you bro üòÄ</p>
 
<p>That‚Äôs pretty much it for R. There were many other
members like ‚ÄúU‚Äù, who supported my decision of blocking R, even though I never blocked her. E who
insisted on that I should use Discord, and greet her, like she does to me, due to
which she clashed with R too. P, R‚Äôs younger
sister(same age as me), who randomly jumped into conversation on my website and
would "blackmail" R. A, who was first female member of chatroom, but still wondered about <q>How many girls you have</q>. Another one who mass liked all my comments but when I told her to not waste her time, she said she was doing deed of friendship and I don't have to return, but I did. But to keep this
section short, I will end it here. But TBH, I feel like U's narrative should have been bigger. It was kinda short in my personal notes too, I did not even realize how supportive she was to me, until 4 year later.</p>

 <p>Unlike in other groups, I <strong>did not leave a successor</strong> behind. Because it wouldn't make sense to do so in here, because the chats were way more individual, many members had soft rivalry, and no one was influential or tech savvy enough to manage my website. I was using R's Instagram account, so she was technically successor, but even she herself deleted both her accounts, a week after my leave. Another thing, I noticed that was many others also deleted their accounts, even on other platforms, after me. E, who I wasn't close with, on just next day. U kept waiting on website for month, celebrated R departure, because I had told her I may return.</p>
 <p>My reason for leaving was not dispute with any member. In fact, I <strong>never had dispute with anyone</strong>. But was privacy, to free up time, focus on Telegram group. </p>


<hr>
 <h3 id="signal-group-signal-15-6">Signal Group, Signal, 15, 6</h3>
 <p>Seeing my previous groups, my classmates said that they also want to learn programming from me. So I created a private group on Signal and 6 of them joined. </p>
 <p>Though none of them was really interested in programming, and had weird requests like hacking someone Instagram. Instead of denying altogether, or guiding them towards their request, I taught them the process of installing Linux, which I labelled as perquisite, technically which it is, but even that was too difficult for them. So instead, I switched to Termux,but even they couldn't do it either and told me to meet them. I refused and said, I won't do anything illegal, see alt for translation.</p>
 <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/signal-group_ybsjfr.jpg" alt="Translation of chat: Me: You haven't downloaded C++, how will you run Aria2 without it. He: Friend can you meet me? Me: [While pointing towards screenshot he sent] Instructions are there, follow that and install it. He: If you can meet me, then do it Me: No, I won't do illegal stuff, and it's very time consuming. I am only guiding you.
/>
 <p>So this group was deleted within a month, without any successor.</p>
 <hr>
 
<h3 id="fanclub-matrix-17-18-200">Fanclub, Matrix, 17-18, 200</h3>
<p>Unlike my other groups, this one was different. It was not
composed just of random Internet strangers, but somewhat familiar
internet people.</p>
<p>Members were very diverse from areas including Americas, Central
Asia, China, Southern Europe. Though there were only 3 members from
Indian subcontinent and only one, I, was active participant.</p>
<p>Diversity was not just limited to nations, there were all kind
of genders, languages here. For example, one of a main member and
future moderator, T, was a trans woman and also a refugee from another room. Another main member and future moderator, A, was a ex muslim, gay communist. Additionally, there was no
main purpose of this group, which can explain the high message
count.</p>
<p>I created this group after I built up enough audience by talking
in other groups, including D, It was intended to be a satire, not
serious, hence it was initially named ‚Äú&lt;my username&gt; fanclub‚Äù
and was private. I did not even share a link. I just said ‚ÄúYou
should join my fanclub for fun.‚Äù</p>
<p>However to my surprise, it grew rapidly. On just <strong>first
day it got around 400 messages</strong>. This made me serious and I
temporarily made this group public, invited lot of other
people.</p>
<p>Two months passed by but the group didn‚Äôt stop growing and
encryption started lagging. So I had to send an
<code>m.room.tombstone</code> event to this one and create another
unencrypted group on another home server.</p>
<p>Shortly after creating a public group, I discovered an abandoned
anime roleplay chatroom with no active moderators. I managed to
revive it by criticizing anime, and later by ‚Äúacting‚Äù as a
moderator of the group, promoting my ideology, encouraging members to move to my group.
Soon they all shifted to my group. That also improved the gender
ratio of my group, because the majority of members there were
females, or at least they claimed to be.</p>
<p>However even after settling in my group, they did continue their
roleplay thing though to a less extent, and even involved me,
though I did not get. Here is an example. X is a placeholder for my
username, P, Q both are from roleplay room.</p>
<pre><code> - P: X is angry at me
 - Q: is he?
 - P: Q, tell X that P left the room
 - P: He can't see me // She thought that I have blocked her
 - Q: okay i gotchu
 - P: Just do it please
 - Q: i will do it for you
 - Q: &lt;@X "Why are you crying lol"&gt; hey P left btw
 - X: I can see her though
 - Q: uh im js saying what i was told
 - X: Haha This P can't stop this lol. Tell her that I am bored of this at this point. 
 - X: I really did a mistake by letting refugees from rp room here.</code></pre>
<p>Below is an example of an average day in that group. We were
discussing a C++ algorithm but one of the regular member posted the
benchmark done on Microsoft Windows. Seeing it was done on Windows,
we started bantering with him. Saying that opinion of a Windows
user is invalid.</p>
<figure><img src=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/v1732789881/fanclub-windows-opinion-invalid-satire_xojiqz.png"
alt="
A: unfortunately using windows disqualifies your opinion from being considered.
B: yea sure ok 
T: one day you will switch to free because
not even you could bear the windows of
future

Me: Windows user opinion don't count. I won as always
</figure>
 <hr>
<h4 id="empirical-study-influence">Empirical Study To Measure Influence</h4>

<p>I even conducted a public, empirical study to measure the influence of selected members(n = 5) of Fanclub. My hypothesis were: I will have the most influence. The more the influence, the more the words will be repeated, through both replies and adoption.</p>

<p>I exported chat logs(n = 8,000) as plain text. With consensus of all participants created sets of signature, unique, words, phrases. Below is an excerpt from the set:</p> 

<pre>
<code class="lang-json">
    {"my_words": ["nice bait", "meds", "group_nick_unity", "group_nick_freedom", "not debating that", "for fun"],
    "a_words": ["gulag",  "group_nick_communism"],
    "t_words": ["omg", "seethe", "purr"]}
</code>
</pre>

<p>A designed a simple shell script using Jq, grep. I implemented bash arrays instead of looping JSON with Jq. I also wished to write it in C++ with B, as I was in my C++ phase then and it would be fun, but I didn't citing that it would take lot of time. I then counted how many times these words were used.</p>

<p>The results fulfilled both hypothesis. After me, A had most influence. T results were not as impressive because she didn't talk much with other members than me, and was not there for long when the data was collected. Other 2 members didn't seem to show much influence. Notably, B use of common words and using Windows might have contributed to it.</p>

<p>Other than showing objective metrics of influence, this study paved the way for other members to conduct more study. Which even made me create a sperate room which served as a "journal" for studies. The requirements to get published there was just to use the Markdown template provided, and add some metadata.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="problems-in-moderation-and-leave">Problems In Moderation
And Leave</h4>
<p>As group started growing even more, it started getting harder to
moderate it. It regularly got raided by spammers who spammed NSFW
media, malware and more. Since Matrix did not have much public
bots, unlike Telegram, this became even more challenging. While
there was an API, but to get most of it you had to host a home
server yourself. I did create some scripts using client API, some
of them are available on my <a href=
"https://github.com/hstsethi/matrix-scripts">Github</a> too.</p>
<p>So I appointed a moderator. But unfortunately, he did not do any
good job. Literally every thing had to be deleted by me. So I came
up with idea of marking group private before going offline and
making it public back when I came. I also reported these incidents
to home server admins, who helped me by deleting their accounts,
messages.</p>
<p>My another reason for leaving was that an ex classmate, to whom
I introduced matrix platform, somehow discovered D group, but not
mine. He recognized me there and started behaving like he was
familiar with me. Members there immediately started being
suspicious of us. I was worried that he might dox me, which he has
history of, or if his OPSEC gets comprised, it will compromise mine
too. So just around hour later, I secretly got him banned from D
group from the hands of my moderator friend.</p>
<p>Around a month later, he met another moderator of D group in an
anime chatroom who not only unbanned him but also spilled the
beans. Hearing that, he also doxed my personal information to him.
I‚Äôm not sure till what extent he did in DMs, but as I saw chat logs
of anime group, he surely did enough. I had created an alt
afterwards but still some users, including the members of my group,
were aware of it, but not the reason of such.</p>
<p>So after 3 months of that dox event, I started sharing my
thoughts of leaving the group and appointed two more moderators.
They were really sad and some of them left immediately after I
left, one of my close friend deleted his account too.</p>
<p>A day later, I came back from an alt account. I replied to one
of the mod, T, and she was shocked that I have not blocked her. I
replied with one of a my signature phrase ‚Äúnice bait‚Äù. I then told
mods that to prepare a list. T replied that all members left after
my announcement, but I encouraged them that I will stay here for
just for them and they got bit happy, see screenshot below.</p>
<figure><img src=

alt=" 
T: What are we seething about currently though? I have missed quite a lot.
Me: This! I only see yours and that {censored username} messages.
T: OMG. You haven't blocked me. ü§ó
Me: Nice bait

Me: I don't want more mental...
T: üòä"/>
</figure>
<p>Later when I did not return after 7 days, the group died, some
more members left and told mods to invite them when I come
back.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs it for this group. Though there are plenty of more things
that I can cover, because it was the longest running group after
all, but it‚Äôs already going very long.</p>

 <h3 id="previous-college-group-whatsapp-18-11">Previous College Group, WhatsApp, 18, 11</h3>
 <p>I was invited to an unofficial group before the start of college. I noticed that people there were way older and they weren't interested in studies, but were openly doing drugs(alcohol, cannabis, hookah), insulting female members, making gangs, planning fights etc.  There was also a language barrier with them speaking regional dialect while discouraging my usage of English, the common language.</p>
<p>In the conversation below, after first day, I ask them a question that if the place in video video they uploaded is our college, but they tell dismiss my question by telling me to smoke and sleep, even though I never talked about any drug there. See Translation in alt.</p>
 <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/is-this-our-college_r3r0mj.jpg" alt="Me: Is this our college? A: You go smoke and sleep ü§£. B: Wow üòÇ B: ü§£  ü§°" />
<p>So I started my own group with same principles as of my previous groups. Advertised it as a safe space for serious studies and chit chat. I got joined by <strong>11 members</strong>. The female members were expressing gratitude to me for creating a group where they wouldn't be insulted due to their skin color or accent.</p>
<p>The admins of the unofficial group were happy that I took serious students out of their group, so they could continue their activities more freely.</p>
<p>This group stayed there for few days until I went to my first day of college, technically the second day, and noticed the bad environment there.</p>
<p>The students were as I expected. Classroom were extremely dirty, crammed with around 90 students in ours. Teachers spoke local dialect and weren't very knowledgeable. One could not even pronounce "environment" correctly. There were no restrooms on our floor. Library was out of stock on almost everything.  A group of unknown boys gathered near my seat. First they wondered that where I came from. I replied that I am Punjabi with a random village name, which doesn't even exist. They asked me how I'm so pale, if I hear Punjabi songs, which I replied no. I didn't tell them I was the one who created the unofficial group. One of them invited me to his bench, I denied it at first but later went.</p>
<p>When classes started, they couldn't even answer basic questions like full form of PCB, difference between direct and alternating current. I anonymously answered "Printed Circiut Board" and they, including teachers, got so shocked that who answered it. A person from group who earlier talked to me shouted, in a overexcited voice, <q>That black shirt Punjabi</q> while pointing towards me. I then raised my hand, stood up, while giggling for a second, which turned contiguous. Teacher asked me about my background and he was also shocked when I said I came from non science background. I didn't reveal my programming background either. Then that held a 5 seconds clapping session for me. After the college ended and some people still congratulated me, joked, with 2 members from my group who found me and didn't even ask for confirmation. One offered to drop me, but I refused. </p>
<p>After that, I planned to leave the college itself. I saw that few people of my group were wondering if that was me, but I didn't respond. Earlier I had told them that I will come this day and they <q>will recognize me upon seeing.</q> I went back to my home the next day early morning, without eating anything or telling to landlady that I'm going forever, because I did not want to stress her. After reaching home, I called her husband and told him that I have left the college and will vacate his room on Sunday. The rent was already paid in advance so there were no issues. Another interesting thing I noticed, in a random video uploaded in group, that at least 5 other males, who were sitting nearby me, 2 females copied my black shirt, one did my metallic silver wrist watch. And few others were sending Punjabi songs in their original unofficial group. Despite teacher <strong>explicly announcing</strong>, on day 1 and repeating on day 2, that only white or navy shirt be wore, with white shoes until uniform is issued. And black is often considered taboo to be worn on beginning of important events. I was flattered that how I got so influential, even in such random decision, but still it didn't convince me to stay.</p>
<p>There were many other positive experiences such as a bus driver stopped midway just for me, when I was leaving and waiting for tuk tuk, and the conductor chatted me the whole journey, despite me not understanding his language. A middle aged, overweight, woman who got influenced by my unsweetened peanut butter choice.
She asked me if it helps in weight loss, how to consume it and if it is tasty. I said that I only eat it because I want to gain weight. It can be connsumed with bread, roti, or milk, but I eat it raw, even though it's not "tasty". Though she still bought 1Kg of it, same quantity as me. Another old man who strangely came directly to me, from a queue, to get his keypad phone fixed, which automatically got fixed when I reinserted the battery and turned of Bluetooth. But that weren't reasons to stay.</p>
 <p>My decision to leave was more complex than that. There were many other issues: staring; in place of living; language barrier; Hookah culture; education quality. </p>
 
<p>After few days of it, I revealed to them that it was me, who answered the questions, as they were wondering, and I left the group without leaving any successor behind. 
</p>
 <p>I still got direct messages from some members who said they want to learn from me. As below conversation shows, one female member requesting my help, but soon I blocked her to focus on finding a good college, excluding the 120+ list of colleges I had made.</p>

 <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/previous-college-ask-my-help_xjgopn.png" alt="She: You are awesome bro. Can you guide me. üôè Me: What help do you want" />
 
<p>Few days later, on Sunday, I came back, with my father, collected all my belongings, got my documents from college and left forever.</p>

<p>Hopefully there was still time left and I was able to enroll myself into an open university and create another group, Freedomphiles, on first day of college, which is described below.</p>

</figure>
<p>I was the first one to realize the importance of having an
unofficial chat group and to create such. I created this group on
very first day of my college.</p>
<p>Following me, many other created groups, but the reason they did
not succeed much because they were not as tech savvy as me, all of
them created specialization specific groups, and lack of
freedom.</p>
<p>I promoted the fact that we all will be following same syllabus
till first year and managed to unite several other unofficial
groups under my community.</p>
<h4 id="spies-in-the-official-group">Spies In The Official
Group</h4>
<p>Just the next day I realized that there were few members among
us who were connected to authorities of the college.</p>
<p>I deduced it by seeing their profile picture, where they looked
older than average first year students, their behavior, attempts to
help students, maintain discipline. The next day, they were
promoted to admins which confirmed by suspicion even more. Also one
such spy admitted being 23.</p>
<p>I added a note in description of my groups that whoever who is
connected to college authorities will be banned on the spot. A week
later, I banned two of them from my group, after failed questioning
with them and an announcement, see screenshot below.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Screenshot of announcement made by

</figure>
<p>As you can see in screenshot below, I questioned him politely,
after fulfilling his request of a code review. I also trapped him
an accusation ‚ÄúIf you are not connected with authorities then why
are you admin? And why is your surname same as of the
ex-admin‚Äù.</p>

<p>Later I also discovered few other ways including asking for
screenshot of their Learning Management System(LMS) and tallying it
with students list which was hidden in LMS. Below is the screenshot
of a female spy who messaged me first but next day, I managed to
make her send me her LMS screenshot which proved to me that she was
in last year, so I had to ban and block her‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Translation of chat: ‚ÄúHer: Proud of you. Let me free you of one
chore, so you can do rest. I will clear your doubt, is it right?
&lt;shares LMS screenshot&gt;. Now breathe if I‚Äôm your favorite.
Thank you. Me: Hmm Thanks lol‚Äù</p>
<h4 id="kickout-from-the-official-group">Kickout From The
‚ÄúOfficial‚Äù Group</h4>
<p>Around 1.5 month later from the above event, I was kicked out
from the official group for pointing out errors in study material
along with screenshots and code example to support my claim. Seeing
this, four members from my group raised their voice against it and
<strong>they were kicked out too.</strong></p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Discussion regarding kicks in my
unofficial group, welcoming them to club of bravery</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Just few days later I observed that the group members who were
kicked out seemed very nonchalant and they refused to email higher
authorities regarding this. They were nonchalant on other issues
and the ones that will happen in future too.</p>
<p>Around two weeks later, I discovered that the <strong>group was
somehow unofficial.</strong> There was only an official community
with teachers who we were familiar with. The university also
repeatedly warned against unofficial groups saying they only had
this community group, nothing else.</p>
<p>Though I refuse to believe that it was unofficial all the way as
we got link of it through email. Maybe they took it‚Äôs authority
later on.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="leaving-and-passing-ownership">Leaving And Passing
Ownership</h4>
<p>I left this group because it felt like an unnecessary
responsibility and talking to a wall. I could not express myself
freely. I had to ‚Äúdumb down‚Äù ideas because I was the only tech
savvy person or active person here, others were not even willing to
learn. I was the only one raising voice against the university,
finding errors in study material. Like in many more cases which I
have not mentioned here.</p>
<p>I passed the ownership to one of the member who later left
himself and passed to another one.</p>
<p>Though still, I continued to speak against wrong things. Below
is an example of me raising voice against rescheduling of classes
in official group and gaining lot of support along the way.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<h3 id="the-importance-of-promoting-activity">The Importance Of
Promoting Activity</h3>
<p>‚ÄúThe members of the group don‚Äôt talk to each other. The
conversations are almost always like DMS to&nbsp;<em>me</em> . They
just come here to talk to me. The group is basically dead when I am
offline.‚Äù</p>
<p>This is what I learned the hard way and wrote it in my personal
notes during my tenure in Telegram group.</p>
<p>
I also realized that mere transformational/charismatic leadership. I would have to introduce them force. It could be either benevolent or coercive. After all, if we look at some notable leaders in history, they all used some sort of force. Be is silencing dissent, isolation, or even "harmless* approaches like micro managing, manipulation.</p>

<p>Learning from my observations, I started encouraging
participation through daily programming, doubt solving , memes and
chit-chat threads, weekly non-fiction literature reading threads. Encouraged posting news, science articles.</p>
<p> I could also take a coercive approach and ban inactive people, ban links to other groups, force members of Freedomphiles to speak against my kick out, errors in study material from official group else get banned or guilt trip them, but I didn't.</p>
<p> However, it's not to say that influence is totally useless. Because if we look at my fanclub example again, I was able to gather lot of members just with a phrase <q>You should Join My fanclub for fun</q></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="importance-of-freedom">Importance Of Freedom</h3>
<p>From start, I have allowed plenty of freedom to members both in
main group and by creating an off topic group.</p>
<p>My groups also had a rule which prohibited ‚Äúrestricting freedom
of speech of others‚Äù, which was strictly enforced.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="maintaining-a-clear-set-of-rules-punishments-awards">
Maintaining A Clear Set of Rules, Punishments, Awards</h3>
<p>As I mentioned above, my groups were very free. However some
things were restricted. I had create set of rules what was
prohibited and how do I define that.</p>
<p>The restricted things included: pornography, gore, restricting
freedom of speech of other, promoting commercial products or
services.</p>
<p>There was a clear hierarchy of ‚Äúpunishments‚Äù and awards. Which
ranged from 1 minute mute, mass social rejection(in form of blocks by members), to permanent ban. Though they were not necessarily punishments. As some people voluntarily requested mutes if the group was too addictive or distracting for them. </p>
<p> There was a system of appeals. Offenders could debate it in Janny Chat, and appeal by writing an essay acknowledging why were they banned, what rule they broke, and how would they act in future</p>
<p>Awards included badges, on platforms which support those,
exclusive access to certain groups, leaderboard and more. Some
members though ‚Äúflexed‚Äù their status of having a high message
count, and being an older member to newcomers but it was all
playful banter.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="using-bots-and-automation-to-ease-up-management">Using Bots
And Automation To Ease Up Management</h3>
<p>Bots proved to be really useful and they are what made 
Telegram group so successful. I really missed them on WhatsApp and Matrix.
But more on Matrix as it had a bigger spam problem and it was
ironic that an open source social media standard did not any bot
community.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="importance-of-being-a-sole-leader">Importance of Being A
Sole Leader</h3>
<p>Being a moderator is not an easy task. An ideal mod would have
knowledge of local languages, tech savvy, respect for freedom,
would not get triggered by insults, explict or shock content.</p>
 <p> An ideal mod would also not block users. Because by blocking users, the mod is basically giving the chance to blocked users to break rules and go unnoticed. This is why I never blocked anyone. I admit that I did ignore many, but didn't block anyone.</p>
<p>Since all of the members were random internet strangers, giving
them power to irreversibly destroy a group did not look like a fair
deal to me.</p>
 
<p>Even if I had given power to some member, which I did at time of leaving by appointing successors, it would be unfair to
others one. Because it would be all my subjective opinion and I
might get accused of favoritism.</p>
<p>Thirdly, as you might have noticed above, they were in the group
because of me. They did not connect with anyone else. They left
when I left. So appointing a leader to which members did not
connect would be wrong too.</p>
<p>Fourthly, The empirical study conducted in <a href="#empirical-study-influence">Fanclub</a> proved that I had highest influence. The fact that none of the groups flourished after I left, even
though I had appointed leaders, is an another empirical evidence
for my claim.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean there was complete "fascism" in my
groups. In fact, I encouraged the members to participate in legal
matters of groups by holding regular polls, and having a seperate
chatroom named "Janny Chat" for anyone who wants to talk to me and
mods.</p>
 <h3 id="importance-own-groups">Importance Of Creating Own Group</h3>
 <p>
A person asked me why did I create my own groups instead of participating in other's group. Well there are lot of reasons for that, such as lack of freedom, unfamiliarity, but the biggest reason is moderators. </p>


<p>In almost all groups I have been banned from, I was banned because the moderators saw me as a threat to their influence. After all, the true leader is one who has influence. And who likes getting their power getting snatched. </p>

<p>They didn't like how an outsider is leading conversations, influencing members to vote against his ban in polls etc. In some cases, even mods themselves have disputes on whether to ban me or not. As one of the mod unbanned me and invited me again, but I refused citing that I have created my own group. </p>

<p>However mods do not know that these bans do not do anything, other than temporarily reliving their insecurity.  Because majority of groups do not have any USP, and bans are easy to evade. In many cases, like T in my fanclub, people who supported me have willingly left the group to join mine, and some of the groups I have created were result of ban.</p>

<p>If we look at above example, you can see that my influence was growing, students were reporting errors in study material, challenging authority. So the moderators bannned me along with 4 others who supported me.</p>
