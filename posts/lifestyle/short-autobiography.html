<p>Below I present a chronological summary, with related evidences
of my whole life, starting from 1, and of other autobiographies I
have written.</p>
<p>The original Short Autobiography, on about page, was getting too
long, hence it has been moved to it's own article. Each age has
it's own section, which contains multiple paragraphs. Unlike
earlier where each age had only one paragraph.</p>
<h2>Short Autobiography</h2>
<h3 id="age-1">Age 1</h3>
<p>Before the age of 2, there isn't anything much I can talk about.
It's mostly really negative experiences which I won't share. Other
than that I managed to survive a feral cat bite that happened when
I was in crib. I started education at just 1.5 by going to a
childcare until admissions opened.</p>
<h3 id="age-2">Age 2</h3>
<p>At the age of 2, I ran away from a school before taking
admission into pre-nursery at another school.  </p>
<h3 id="age-3">Age 3</h3>
<p>At the age of 3, I had to do pre-nursery again in another
school, which ate my "early bird advantage" and dragged me down to
those who started at "normal age". Learned writing in English,
Hindi, Punjabi, sorted in order of proficiency that time.</p>
<p>Learned about technology including installing third party apps,
Bluetooth, web browsing etc, through a Symbian device. Collected stones a bit but
later stopped in favor of plants. Survived brain trauma caused by accidental fall to head, and I had no role in it.</p>
<h3 id="age-4">Age 4</h3>
<p>At age of 4, I did my first shallow water swim. Expanded my
knowledge of technology, using only J2ME phones and slow internet
connection. I utilized various methods including overnight, bulk
downloads and keeping device in open area. Discovered the basic concept of elasticity, magnetism through "playing" with magnets, bouncing balls, which I had bought myself, with my own money, rubber bands etc.</p>
<p>Started teaching myself English. I learned it through many
sources including newspapers, books, writing, reading a dictionary,
watching non-fiction television channels including History TV 18,
Discovery, Animal Planet, Nat Geo etc.</p>
<h3 id="age-5">Age 5</h3>
<p>At the age of 5, I started collecting coins, notes and got my
first gold medal in overall academics, by scoring highest, which was also first possible
gold medal as before that, there were no awards.</p>
<p>Discovered astrology, horoscope in a newspaper. Initially
thought it a "Book for predicting future", due to credibility of
newspapers, but rejected it due to lack of accuracy, impossibility
of predicting future for such large amount of people with limited
number of signs, and vague statements.</p>
<p>Almost amputated my finger while trying to open an electronic
with a knife. I still have wound of this.</p>
<h3 id="age-6">Age 6</h3>
<p>At the age of 6, I got <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/v1734071591/silver-medal-sof-with-age-6-gold-medal_vng5vt.jpg">
another gold medal</a>, gave my first public speech at school, was
forced to play a role into school annual function and continued
coin collection. I also started collecting APKs, after learning the process of backing, editing up them, which was very helpful to me due to low storage, and internet speeds. </p>
<p>Started climbing trees and practicing jumping. It should be
noted that I did not jump out of sake of it, but for a practical
necessity, such as travel, retrieving ball, playing hide and seek
etc. I employed proper techniques such as hanging to reduce
distance. I also did not try rolling or back flip, despite an
unsolicited advice of a self proclaimed expert, because I knew a
roll technique he was teaching could break the neck, which is way
worse than breaking limbs; my jumps weren't really that high which
warranted a roll; possibility of pebbles on ground.</p>
<h3 id="age-7">Age 7</h3>
<p>Served as discipline manager for whole academic session.</p>
<p>I learned about firecraft including firepit, boiling, roasting
plant material, pottery, blacksmithing(didn't practice due to
improper equipment), realizing that dry leaves aren't really dry.
Started long distance cycling(total 10Km + a day), despite being
underweight(BMI &lt; 13)</p>
<h3 id="age-8">Age 8</h3>
<p>At the age of 8, I started teaching myself basic theoretical
electricity. I wrote my <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/how-mk-electrical-formula-nb.jpg">
own note</a> titled “How to Make Electric Formulas”. Convinced my
parents to stop sending me to tuitions which led to increase in
grades, freedom, decrease in costs. I <strong>haven't taken any
tuition since then</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="age-9">Age 9</h3>
<p>At the age of 9, I started focusing more on stationery, software
side of technology, learned about modding Android applications to remove ads, in-app purchases. Wrote a mathematical table reference notebook. Won a mental maths quiz and an English poem
recitation competition in school.</p>
<p>Started volunteering by counting, curating donations at a
temple, where my father held voluntary managerial position.</p>
<h3 id="age-10">Age 10</h3>
<p>By the age of 10, I had shaped my interest in finance,
technology, felids/nature, stationery collection. I had negative
experience with all of them but <strong>that didn't stop
me.</strong> Rather they had an opposite effect.</p>
<p>I started taking my stationery collection seriously. I also
introduced this hobby, trading, written communication using obscure
words, tabletop games, hidden pockets and bills to my classmates. I
had <strong>collected 227 sharpeners, over 150 pens</strong>
through both trading, purchasing and deterring thieves on the basis
of maths teacher.
 
 
<p>Maths teacher considered me her "favorite student", gave me
“Smart and Cool :smile:” on <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/smart-cool-rc-10_fmradg.jpg">
official report card,</a> forced me to eat my lunch in front of her, and also gave keys to her personal locker, but I never used it for personal storage. 
I was the only student who sat with opposite gender. She forced me to sit with one girl for a week, who was not very intelligent and came from a lower socioeconomic class in efforts to teach her. Until I told her that it is "impacting my studies".</p>
<p>I also played the front role in school annual function, again
forcefully admitted, but had privilege of being only student
excluded from makeup(skin whitening powder), because I am already 
pale, and wearing my own jacket(because according to teachers, including of maths, it
looked good).</p>
<p>Also scored 96/100 in environmental science, A1 in oral exams of
all 3 languages, of mathematics, despite being forced to take Sanskrit, instead of
Punjabi, till age 13, due to lack of choice by school.</p>
<h3 id="age-11">Age 11</h3>
<p>At the age of 11, I gave up on stationery collection and also
personally donated it to poor students who passed an oral test. 
Started writing small bat scripts using Exagear, Wine layer for
Android.</p>

 <p>Started playing Punjabi Kabbadi, cold bathes(all seasons), watching WWE and introduced these to classmates. Secretly walked into a cremation ground, and was surprised by seeing children playing there. Debunked the existence of paranormal beings, a popular
topic of discussion, by writing a note employing both philosophical
and scientific arguments, including limitations of a mobile application. United my school friend circle, made my friends stop using profanity, crying(once again), which was my own choice, not my job as a discipline manager. </p>
<p>Was forced to do another role, of a camel herder and coconut seller,
but my two partners, who both happened to be my friends, considered the role of camel "inferior",
<strong>falsely accused</strong> me of favoritism, hence they did
not come on that day, started crying on next day. So I had to herd a random, costumesless
students which prevented us from winning. While role giving teacher did consider me favorite student a bit, forced me to eat lunch in front of her in staffroom. But it was false, because role was based on merit of me being underweight(hence easier to ride another student's back), being good with studies, ability to afford costumes, gender(herder role was exclusively for males with females having exclusive role of dancers), and others, which was same for another herder.</p>
<p>Served as discipline manager, first bencher, time tracker for
whole session of class. Because teacher, different from
previous one, didn't have a watch and considered me her favorite
student. Also helped her in a profitable business deal with my father.</p>

<h3 id="age-12">Age 12</h3>
<p>At the age of 12, I began teaching myself basics of Linux,
Programming and cybersecurity, and started using it for my day to
day computing needs and for automating repetitive tasks. Started
from Java, but switched to Python a month later. I used Termux
because I didn't have a computer.</p>
<p>Received <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/v1734071591/silver-medal-sof-with-age-6-gold-medal_vng5vt.jpg">
silver medal from Science Olympiad Foundation.</a> Got a candid photo of me, during writing in a notebook, taken by science teacher and featured in
front page of school magazine.  Despite failing to attend district level science quiz, and leading to loss of our team, disappointing her. Got my seat fixed with my friend as a "punishment". </p>
<p>Created a digital wallet and started earned
<strong>₹700</strong> through referrals, micro tasks, quizzes and
some real money mini gaming. Avoided getting bitten by a rabid dog
by kicking it and washing off saliva from trousers.</p>
<h3 id="age-13">Age 13</h3>
<p>At the age of 13, I started <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/gta-sa-mob-mod-menu_iitddh.jpg">
making mods</a> for GTA: SA mobile version. While I did not like
video games, music back then either, but I liked tinerking. It had
huge set of resources and it was possible to create mods without a
computer.</p>
<p>I created my own group for computer, cybersecurity related
discussions, that gained <strong>over 100 members</strong>, from
all over the world. </p>
 
<p>Improved my knowledge of Bash, as a language, regular expressions and other text processing utilities. Started learning about finance, stocks,
cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Scored 89/100 in science(bio, chem, phy), despite being forced
Sanskrit again with an unfavorable male teacher, who broke the
"streak of favoritism", by unfairly targeting me, physically beating me. The score is also less than what teacher, had expected from a favorite student. So she wrote on my <a href="">report card,</a> <q>[my name] is an active boy. He should use his capabilities to perform better</q>. Became favorite student of another teacher. While she didn't teach our class, but whenever she came, she would make me sit solo, front of her, and encourage me finish my lunch, even if it's not recess. She also liked my efficient way of completing exam, self learning(early forms of SDL), and preached this to other students using my example, even encouraging them to write during reading time, which is not allowed but I still used to do.
</p>
<h3 id="age-14">Age 14</h3>
<p>At the age of 14, I bought my own phone, for online classes,
after plenty of research, and debloated, customized it on first
day.</p>

<p>Became favorite student of another teacher, despite not attending school and attending online classes only during time of attendance, then leaving. She understood my self learning style, goals, and didn't force me to attend online classes. She even defended me during exam, at age 17, when a jealous student said something bad about to me her, and she replied, in front of whole class, <q>He is very intelligent(2x). He will score high if he is does commitment.</q>, and further made fun of that student. </p>
<p>I started a YouTube channel. I closed it after I got strike on a
video where I taught how to make and execute prank bat "viruses" on
Android using Exagear and another strike for using copyrighted SFX
in my botany video.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of Covid-19 lockdown, resumed daily, long
distance cycling, continued <strong>despite accident with a
car</strong>.</p>
<p>Made a profit of around $13 in cryptocurrency, and another $105
in crypto demo account, but as I was a minor at that time, I was
not able to withdraw it. So I started focusing more on programming,
trading equities in demo account.</p>
<h3 id="age-15">Age 15</h3>
<p>At the age of 15, I created <strong>three groups</strong> and my
own Telegram Bot, introduced weekly non-fiction reading threads.
One on Telegram for computer and cryptocurrency discussion that
gained <strong>over 150 members and 50 more</strong> from
collabration with a Russian group. Another one on my own private
web chat platform, 9 members all female. Another one on Signal, for
teaching my classmates.</p>
<p>Made my first pull request <a href=
"https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/pull/1049">first pull request</a>
in open source project, and also did <a href=
"https://github.com/fmhy/edit/pull/9">very first contributions</a>,
<strong>pull request number 9, 10</strong> to Free Media Heck Yeah
Project.</p>
<p>Started earning by facilitating in-game micro transactions for
others. Started with opening balance 1,500, and ended with closing
balance of 10,000.</p>
<p>Started learning about internet privacy and security. After
gaining enough knowledge about it, I began taking steps to protect
myself including purging all my identities, groups, accounts,
turning off JavaScript, LUKS full disk encryption, using a VPN
24X7, though I used it earlier too but not always on.</p>
<p>Bought a used, dead, 32 bit, 1 Gb ram computer and solely
repaired, upgraded, fine tuned it to purpose as daily driver. 
Tested 30 video games in it, deleted 28 within 30 minutes, 2 within 1 hour. Helped create mods for 1. </p>
<p>Scored 90/100 in grade 10 English(Advanced). Made correct
decision by choosing commerce stream over medical, engineering,
despite no previous experience, pressure from parents, friends, and
former teachers, who were all STEM and encouraged me to switch <strong>even during early days</strong> of commerce class. But in the end, I had last laugh. <a href=
"#footnote-6">[^6]</a></p>
<h3 id="age-16">Age 16</h3>
<p>Age of 16 was true transitory period unlike 17, I set
earlier.</p>
<p>I started relearning about nature, wilderness and urban survival, martial arts(Realized their ineffectiveness even before attending any classes), and preparedness.
Identified local flora, fauna. English language(IPA, Grammar, style). Created a <a href=

primitive compass</a> using only <strong>one stick, two
pebbles</strong> and astronomical knowledge. Did my first
lacto-fermentation, of Solanum Nigrum. Wrote a <a href=

philosophy, mathematics(modified SDL approach), nutrition,
pharmacy.</p>

 <p>
Resisted antibiotics, cosmetics, and fake treatments of a dermal issue in favor of holistic approach, and self-prescribed topical pharmaceuticals. Gained more scientific reasons to avoid cosmetic, which I always did.</p>
<p>Convinced my father to open an equity trading account for me,
and I started investing my savings into low expense-ratio ETfs and
few individual stocks. In less than 6 months, I was able to make a
<strong>profit of around 10%</strong>. Learned about XMR(Monero)
algorithm, experimented with test net and mining.</p>
<p>Uploaded my first project, <a href=

electrical engineering through use of simulators. Most of my
reverse engineering projects were done in Windows XP, DOS, some in
<a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/macos-9-sheep-shaver-cg_i0evdy.png">
Mac OS 9.</a> As seen in the <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/xp-office-97-re_txmdhl.png">

Office 97 <strong>only by using Borland Turbo</strong> and Notepad
in Windows XP. Other things I reverse engineered are old J2ME
software, firmware for my Awesome J2ME project, Android apps for
removing unnecessary bloatware, permissions.</p>
<p>Became favorite student again, of multiple teachers, despite
completely new teachers, subjects, students. Was only one to be allowed to do just examples instead of questions in homework. Only one to not have economics, though it wasn't favoritism but loophole, allowed to bring phone in classroom(though I didn't much out of respect), and other school
relationships, which I won't detail. Scored <strong>95/100</strong>
in grade 11 Information Technology, which is highest score in whole
session, across all sections. Served as monitor in computer lab,
for whole session. Helped students, teachers in technical tasks.
Served in English lab too, due to my constantly highest scores in
pronunciation and essay writing, reading exams</p>

<a href="posts/programming/best-programming-language-you-enjoy-most">
what programming career to pursue</a>, what projects to make, business/startup plans, experimented with different
programming career, how should I handle legal matters after turning
18, created a genealogy tree with <strong>100+ nodes</strong>, and
more.</p>
<p>Learned about various equity related strategies through paper

<p>Successfully resisted against psychoactive "medicine", by
debating psychiatrist, for chronic insomnia, help gain weight, and
some other false diagnosed mental illnesses including paranoia,
trauma, which was diagnosed on basis of challenges I faced, not on
how I feel about them, in favor of a holistic approach, including
improving my method of mindfulness meditation, of sun bathing,
diet, which worked to a great extent.</p>
<p>I bought a custom built laptop, and customized it further.

nuts, legumes for increasing bioavailability, but later stopped
after learning about habitats of pathogens, seasonal changes, and
broader change in view about bioavailability, though I never faced
any consequences. </p>

reservation was there) or formal education, but I could not attend
due to financial issues. none of the subjects I studied in high
school were evaluated in exam. Switched two different universities,
rooms before enrolling myself into an open university, due to low
fees and high freedom. Despite not studying at all, focusing on stock market, poor conditions, I was the <strong>first one to complete all of my final, first semester exams</strong>. I completed all 5 exams, which were of 150 minutes, with <strong>M: 24.2, SD: 2.4 </strong>.

survive winters</a> and intruders there, including a sexual
molestation by a "hijra", which I survived through jumping through
moving tuk tuk, assertiveness, lying and recording evidence, which
I will release in March. Later raised voice regarding the neglect
in LGBT communities leading to unbanning of word "hijra". Tested
and reviewed two pepper sprays in real life conditions(no
protective equipment, both close and long range etc). Developed and

<p>That was just a start. I strongly believe in <a href=
"#footnote-2">self directed[^2]</a>, lifelong learning. I am
continuously learning new things, learning from my previous
mistakes. I do not solely focus on technology and finance. I also
do have knowledge of various other topics including
philosophy(epistemological skepticism, <a href="#footnote-3">truth,
aesthetics as spectrum[^3]</a> naturism, asceticism(as a means to
end, not the end in itself), pragmatism, <a href=
"https://hstsethi.vercel.app/posts/philosophy/nature-achievements">individual
and objective achievements</a>, existentialism, political
philosophy), psychology, nature(preparedness, wilderness, first
aid, botany, felids), biology(evolutionary, nutrition), business,
culture(genealogy, language, history, religion).</p>
<p>Things I dislike<a href="footnote-4">[^4]</a> are: Fiction(art,
<a href="posts/programming/reasons-i-am-not-gamedeveloper">video
games</a>, music, movies, "true" crime, comedy, documentaries,
novels, self-help, ...). Consumerism(foodism<a href=
"#footnote-5">[^5]</a>, pet culture, modern education system, modern web, emoji, <a href=
"posts/programming/why-i-hate-email-notifications">email

behaviour(anti-intellectualism, profanity, <a href=

arguing on the internet or with fools</a>, inherent or group based

<p>I never focused much on academics, consider them waste of time. Yet, I was able to score
high, gain medals, win quizzes, become favorite student of
multiple teachers, many teachers had high expectations from me, I was always the first one to complete exams, all
without going to tuitions, not having any reservations, and having achievements in other areas. There were some rumors, nicknames, that
my classmates spread, not just about me, but <strong>about teachers</strong> too.
Along with jumping up on me in groups a few times. That my
connections with teacher helped in that, but they couldn't explain
how I scored on exams checked by external teachers. Or a top
bookworm said that I intentionally did not write correct answers. Or I cheated in exams, but the nearby students were themselves
dependent on me. Or that I bathe with milk, or impact of feral cat
bite. But as always, I did not care, other than last one which I
accepted jokingly and some students, particularly female one,
started actually bathing with milk, hoping for skin whitening
benefits too, and then complaining it didn't work.</p>

<p>Despite facing so much physical and mental trauma, I have not
experienced any major setbacks. I haven't even ever cried since age 6. Zero bones broken, no burns, dog
bites, loss of consciousness, hospital admits, major food
poisonings, all limbs, finger intact. Though I would still like to
warn readers to be cautious. <strong>Maintain your
distance</strong> from unknown plants, animals, surroundings and
humans.</p>
 
<h3>About Short Autobiography</h3>
<p>Evidence images are not displayed inline due to lack of space
and to speed up loading. Those linked in autobiographies are not
linked here. You can jump to account of specific age by appending
"#age-n" to the URL. Where {n: 1 - 18}. Or you can use POSIX SH
<em>get-random-auto-bio-account</em> <a href=
"https://github.com/hstsethi/hstsethi.vercel.app/blob/main/scripts/get-random-auto-bio-account.sh">
script</a>, which I personally use. It “Returns HTML of random
account from short-autobiography and renders it.”</p>
<p>While this autobiography may give a picture that my life is a
bed of roses, it's far far from truth. I have faced, and still
face, many challenges, criticisms, rumors, insults, but I have
not mentioned them here, even though they could amplify my success,
and raise donations. Because: I don't see any merit in crying or
swiping the victim card; I don't wish to traumatize people; it is
hard to explain objectively; this site is SFW; what people say doesn't affect me; my challenges are
also a reason behind my success. While I do mention some important
ones, I stress on how I overcame them.</p>
<p>As this autobiography is a result of connecting, fact-checking
thousands of sources. I have used my own memory, a lot of sources,
and shared many as "proofs" whenever feasible. I just don't recall,
I also note down how much variables of episodic memory I could
recall and find insights in them. My other sources are asking
others, my old handwritten written material, other memories* my notes, journal,
todo list, school awards, topics of books, screenshots, chat logs,
recordings, bookmarks*, bank history, browser
history, OSINTing myself, digital forensics, weather, config and
data files, legal documents etc.</p>
<p> *: Important source </p>
<p>For example, a method I used recently. I was recalling a
specific song that was being played during an event. I knew that
during that time, the song was newly released and was playing
everywhere. I searched on YouTube and checked the release date of
song. I used that, along with other clues like weather, to deduce
the exact date of the event. While I don't listen to music
intentionally, I was often forced to do so due to environment. I
use similar method with book topics, software release, other events
etc.</p>
<p>But few of sources have been lost with time. Some evidences were
never recorded. One such source was a magazine which my school
published, on which I was featured on multiple times. Some of my
digital sources were lost after I realized the importance of
internet privacy at age of 15. And data loss at 16.</p>
<p>Still think my autobiography is fake? Well you can challenge me
and win rewards. 100 rupees for proving any of my claim false(Did
not happen at all), 150 rupees for proving the opposite of what is
claimed, ie net loss instead of net profit. Public apology and your
name will be permanently listed here. This only applies to this
article, not to any other opinion, idea expressed by me.</p>
<p>All claims must contain the following metadata: year, evidence,
how you obtained the evidence, why you think it's false.</p>
<p>Failure to adhere to any of the requirement will permanently
disqualify you. You can make unlimited claims, hence earn unlimited
money, but getting your two claims proved wrong will also
permanently disqualify you.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<li>
<p id="footnote-1">Felids do not just refer to domestic cats.
Felids refer to any genera within <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_felids">felidae family</a>.
I used this word, instead of "cat", because many people were
confused. I do not just admire domestic cats, I am more intereseted
in studying all genera within felidae family, including <em>Felis,
Acinonyx, Panthera</em>, and their respective species, from a
biological perspective, in their natural habitat. This is one of
the many reasons I do not have pets. My another reason is that I
don't have access to meat.</p>

<p id="footnote-2">Self Directed Learning(SDL) means not following
any fixed roadmap, syllabus, instructions of someone. It is
inherently open ended, curiosity, skepticism driven and subjective.
It can not be taught, as building blocks of it like curiosity,
critical thinking abilities, IQ are innate. For example, Wikipedia
rabbit hole, exploring an unknown environment, my approach of SDL
where I do not read much books, watch courses, follow a roadmap, or
practice isolated or repeated set of exercises. Instead, I first
mediate on the topic. Then I seek relevant literature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="footnote-3">Truth, aesthetics both exist on a spectrum,
because our senses are not perfect. They are neither exclusively
objective or subjective, they are both. It depends on the context
and claim which is being made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="footnote-4">I consider the idea of absolutely hating a thing
to be anti-intellectualism. It is very rare to hate all aspects of
a thing. I have tried or studied about everything I dislike. Even
for the things I dislike, there are few things in them which I
admire. Additionally, the above list is a list of things I dislike,
not what I want government to ban, or people to start disliking
too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="footnote-5">While I dislike onion, garlic, ketchup, spices,
and condiments, I don't consider myself a "picky eater", but a
<strong>rational eater</strong>. I eat food only to fulfill my
nutritional needs, even if it's not considered tasty.</p>
</li>

<p id="foonote-6">But in the end, I had last laugh, as majority of
them had enrolled into commerce or humanities course despite
wasting so much time, money on tuitions, taking drop years. This
isn’t just an anecdotal observation. More than <strong>34,000 of
them dropped out</strong> between 2019-2022, as Hindustan Times
<a href=

report</a>. Such students also have high suicide rates, 13,089
alone in 2021 as per Times of India report. Another <a href=

report by Ministry of Education</a> itself details on mental impact
of such peer pressure. 75% of students with bachelors in
engineering pursue MBA, a completely unrelated management program,
