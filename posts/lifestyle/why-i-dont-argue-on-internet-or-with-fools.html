<h1>Why I Don't Argue on The Internet or With Fools</h1>
<q>Never argue with a fool; onlookers may not be able to tell the
difference.</q> <cite>Mark Twain</cite>
<p>Arguing on the internet is the most pointless thing. Despite
being a sole admin of <a href=
"https://hstsethi.vercel.app/posts/lifestyle/lessons-learned-founding-internet-groups-memoir">
various internet groups</a>, cycling through various identities,
platforms, I never engaged into "debates" on the internet. Not to
mention that majority of "debates" on the internet aren't even
debates.</p>
Whenever someone tries to debate with me, I end it by saying,
<q>Lmao, I am not debating that</q>, <q>Nice bait</q> or just by
simply laughing at them for being way too excited, interested to
change someone's opinion on internet, prove them wrong.
<p>I apply this advice everywhere in my life, not just on internet.
Not only it has saved me a lot of stress, but most important thing
is that it saves me time too.</p>
