Is Nature Of Achievements? Do Achievements Speak Louder Than Words</h1>
<p>In this article I will share my own prospective on achievements. What
things are I consider as achievements, what I do not. What Is nature of
achievements, what do I mean when I say “Achievements Speak Louder Than
Words”.</p>
<h2 id="nature-of-achievements">Nature Of Achievements</h2>
<p>Achievements refers to something extraordinary, difficult done by an
individual. They are objective, personal, have instrumental value and
speak louder than words.</p>
<p>Achievement is a milestone towards success but not success in
itself.</p>
<p>All achievements are personal. Even in cases of collective
achievements like winning in a war, research, it’s individuals who, in
the end, achieved it. Hence they are one whom credit should be
given.</p>
<p>There are no objective basis of giving credit to intermediaries,
however that doesn’t mean their contributions should not be
acknowledged. It is up to achiever if he wants to acknowledge them or
not.</p>
<p>True achievements speak louder than words. That means they are
objective and hold way more value than words, intermediary actions. They
can be measured through objective lenses including standardized tests,
leaderboard, ratios.</p>
 <p>"Lack of resources" is not a valid argument. Nowadays, everyone has access to internet. If they are not using it in a pragmatic way, it's all their fault. I myself did not have much acess to internet, but I used resources like old newspapers which were provided to me by free from shopkeepers(age 4), and magazines, manuals provided to my father by his job(age 8).</p>
 <p>Even after reading my autobiographies, many people have asked me how did I succeed. It's difficult to answer, as success is subjective, but achievements are objective. Success is just making right decisions early on, while avoiding wrong decisions or not getting too late, as time never comes back. It's about being free from external influences and <strong>deviating from the norm</strong>. Some level of sleep deprivation, social isolation is necessary for it. While luck does not exist, randomness does a play a minor role too by introducing the oppurtunities at most. SDL, my self directed learning method.

<h2 id="what-things-are-not-achievements">What Things Are Not
Achievements</h2>
<h3 id="achievements-one-had-no-role-in">Achievements One Had No Role
In</h3>
<p>This includes achievements of one’s nation, achievements of friends,
of one’s community, of ancestors, which is described in section
below.</p>
<p>Because one nation is not a “reward” of hard work, it’s just random
event. If someone legally immigrates to any other country, that still
wouldn’t make him eligible to take credit of achievements of that
nation. In that case, only achievement would be of successfully
immigrating.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="achievements-of-ones-ancestors">Achievements of One’s
Ancestors</h3>
<p>Similar to the achievements in which one plays no role, but the
reason it’s a separate section because unfortunately, lot of people take
pride in what their alleged ancestors achieved. Instead, such people
should be asking themselves, “My ancestors achieved so much, but why I
have not achieved having despite having supposedly”superior” genes.
Because, if I had any, I wouldn’t resort this”.</p>
<p>My own ancestors had many achievements, which I won’t be discussing
here. My skin is paler than average countryman. My last name, Sethi,
literally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sethi">translates to
“Superior”</a>. Or<a href="#footnote-1">[^1]</a> “It is derived from Sanskrit šreṣtbdot;hī , which
denotes the head of a mercantile or other guild.”</p>
<p>But I simply acknowledge them. I do not take any pride in it. Not
only because it’s illogical, but also because I have plenty of my own
achievements, which I earned on my own.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="something-that-is-not-difficult">Something That Is Not
Difficult</h3>
<p>These includes many things like certificate of participation, self
proclaimed achievements, word of mouth without any objective basis.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="something-that-has-no-instrumental-value">Something That Has No
Instrumental Value</h3>
<p>Including achievements in video games, an invention with no practical
applications, idea that’s too utopian.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="achievements-achieved-through-unfair-means">Achievements
“Achieved” Through Unfair Means</h3>
<p>This can include various things like cheating in exams, inheritance,
trying to gain Github achievements by gaming system,</p>
<p>Unlike in other sections, examples in this section might not be
objective. As some of them involve ethical issues. They might have many
answers depending on the context. Or some may be objective too. This is
a long debated issue in philosophy.</p>
<p>However by saying this, I am not contradicting my earlier statement
of achievements being objective. For example, the marks obtained by
cheating in exams would still be interpretable through objective
lenses.</p>
<p>One of the objective one, Github achievements, is described
below.</p>
<p>A lot of people I have observed try to game the system by creating
private repositories, sending pull requests to own repository from a
different branch and more.</p>
<p>But these achievements then become tainted.</p>
<p><img

loading="lazy"
alt="Tainted YOLO achievement showing inaccessible message" /></p>
<p>Notice that inaccessible error message, that they were achieved by
someone who attempted to game the system, but ended up getting
permanently gamed by it, as achievements can not be re-earned.</p>
<p>Similarly, I could also do the same, but I choose to not too. I
prefer to earn them legitimately and also because I don’t like games, as
I described in my <a
href="https://hstsethi.vercel.app/posts/programming/reasons-i-am-not-gamedeveloper">previous
article</a> too!</p>
<p>Additionally, some of the achievements like <a
href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/39281">YOLO</a>,
which is awarded after merging a pull request without review, is a bad
practice. It’s not something to be proud of but to be ashamed of, at
least to me. So, I will try not to achieve it.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="Sucess-not-just-an-achievement">Success Is Not Just An
Achievement</h3>
<p>Success is defined by individual, hence there is no objective
definition of it. While achievements are objective, success is no.
Success is not just collection of achievements, but it includes other
things too including satisfaction, personal development, experience
which is impossible to measure objectively.</p>
<p>For example, for me achieving so much at the age of 18, writing this
article, despite having all odds against me is a big success for me and
I am satisfied. For someone who does not know about my circumstances,
have not read my articles, might not consider me as successful as I
consider myself, but we both can agree on objective achievements like <a
href="posts/finance/from-coins-to-25-equity-at-18">25% in equity</a>,
865/~8000 rank in entrance exam, <a
href="lifestyle/lessons-learned-founding-internet-groups-memoir">member
count of my groups</a> etc. Gaining that high rank without formal
education, reservations is also a big success to me, but again, how do
we measure the circumstances? How do we assign weights to them
objectively? There are countless variables that are impossible to know,
let even measure objectively, life is inherently unfair.</p>
<h2 id="what-things-are-achievements">What Things Are Achievements</h2>
<p>Some of the true achievements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Original contributions to body of knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Something extraordinary, uncommon, difficult and
original</p></li>
<li><p>Something that has an instrumental value</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="related-ideas">Related Ideas</h2>
<p>I do not read much original philosophical works, so I can't speak
much on it. However from my research, these ideas are similar to
mine.  My knowledge of philosophical terms comes from a need to express my own ideas in a concise and well accepted manner. <strong>I do not read philosophical works</strong>. I highly prefer, real life problem solving, analytical work. However from my research, these ideas are similar to
mine. </p>
<li></p>
<ul>
<li>Meritocracy</li>
<li>Individualism</li>
<li>Bradford, Gwendolyn. Achievements. Yale University, 2010.</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068">Talent vs Luck: the role of randomness in success and failure</a></li>
<p>While I do agree that randomness does play a role in success and failure, it does not as much as the paper linked above says so. It mostly helps by introducing an individiual to oppurtunities. The paper also makes a <strong> huge oversimplification.</strong> The impact of dot is fixed, a constant reduction or increase in capital. Whether an agent will get lucky or unlucky is independent of his talent points. There could be cases when someone with higher talent points got lucky as well and opposite, but it's all random and doesn't translate to real life. </p>
