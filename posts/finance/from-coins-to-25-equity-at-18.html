    <h1>From Coins to 25%, 1.10k+ In Equity At 18</h1>
<p>Below is my life story from a financial perspective. Specifically how I started from collecting coins at age of 5 and then reached 100,000+ in equity at 18.</p>
 <p>This is my personal story. None of it is financial advice, if it wasn't obvious by now. Many people have asked me to include what stocks did I buy, what strategy did I use. Giving financial advice without proper certifications, which I neither have nor want, is a crime according to the government. Also I don't want to reveal my cards.

<h2 id="childhood-interest-in-coin-collection-5---6">Childhood
Interest in Coin Collection, 5 - 6 </h2>
<p>This is probably the hobby that paved the way for my interest in
finance. While I mostly collected exotic Indian coins, I also did have
some paper notes, and foreign currencies too.</p>
<p>Most of my coins came from buying it from beggars at a price higher
than their face value.</p>
<p>This hobby was kinda expensive and required traveling to some
potentially unsafe places. It was impossible for 5 year old me to
sustain it, so I soon at age 6, I left it.</p>
<p>Below is the picture of notes from my collection. 4 Indian Rupee
notes. 3x One Rupee and 1x of two rupees</p>

<h2 id="collecting-trading-stationery">Collecting, Trading Stationery(9 - 11)</h2>
<p>I started collecting stationery at age of 9. By the age of 10, I had started taking my stationery collection
seriously. I also introduced this hobby to my classmates, and it spread
like fire. I also started trading stationery with them. I named this act
"Soada", which is Punjabi word for "deal". I mostly traded stationery
for non stationery items including food, money and others. I kept a
written, signed bill of each item traded for just in case. I also
introduced written form of communication in form of paper balls letters
with some obscure words.</p>
<p>Some of my most notable trades were soft drink, chips nuts, and which in return, I got two pocket sized Oxford
dictionaries. Cash, listening to stories of a classmate's father stationery shop from which I got an obscure sharpener from her. Pack 50 pens, 2 Rupee, each from a village student for
cash. Mathematics table, formula notebook, which I wrote myself, for 5 sharpeners. An imported chocolate, for which Y testified, post trade, in boasting manner that it's indeed imported, in return for 7 sharpeners. A small carton of juice(10 rupees) for mechanical pencil(worth 15 new) from Z. She believed in mobile app ghosts, played video games, ate meat(which was considered taboo), and by her own admission, was "Not like rest of girls". She later even started doing experiments, playing pen fighting with me, and other minor trades.
 </p>
<p>I was specially fond of pencil sharpeners and pens. I had <strong>127
pencil sharpeners, 100+ pens</strong>, 30+ erasers. Thefts were pretty
common too, so I had "secret pockets" in my bags, coats which were
carved out using sharpener blade. I also managed to convince some
thieves to not steal my items, else I will complain them to our teacher, A, who considered me as her "favorite student" and gave me <q> Smart and Cool :smile:</q> on official report card, and keys to her personal locker in staffroom, exemption from makeup(skin whitening powder, lipstick), because I am already pale, and allowing me to wear my own jacket function and allowing me to wear my own jacket. While I had access to A's personal locker, I never used that for my personal storage or even requested her for that. </p>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/smart-cool-rc-10_fmradg.jpg" alt="My report card that has written Smart and Cool followed by a smile emoji" />

 
 <p> There were also some ideological differences. For example, one rival turned trading partner collected pencil leads from wooden pencils by repeatedly sharpening it, which I, and A both, found valueless and waste but we didn't object. Another one was with many others who were so keen on displaying their collections publicly to almost everyone but I was opposed to this. Due to concerns of theft and whole class already knew this. But some show off was also necessary as form of advertising, so I kept my bragging tendencies to limited circle. I used to say, <q>Why should I bend and look down , laugh on others instead of making others look up and they will notice automatically.</q></p>
 
 
<p>In addition to that, we did many other things including <a
href="#footnote-1">Pen fighting[^1]</a>, "experiments" with stationery,
writing short reference books, throwing our stationery out of window on
the porch and then rolling them down through water pressure. The one who
managed to do this could keep all of them.</p>
<p>I stopped this hobby at age of 11 because it was getting way
too expensive, my step mother had discovered my stash, thieves had left the school, our school was getting
strict to the point that they confiscated my cash, expensive stationery. Though I got them back after my father wrote a note to them. And I also became favorite student of another two teachers, which also helped, read more in my short-autobiography. I also had started focusing on programming and later
finance. Though my stationery didn't go waste. I personally donated many
to poor students, including poor non-school friends(Group A), who passed an oral test, and still use some of the items.</p>

 <h2 id="making-beer-money">Making Beer Money, 12.5 - 13.5</h2>
 <p>At the age of 12.5, I created a Paytm account with Mini KYC, and started earning through referrals, micro tasks, quizzes and some real money gaming.</p>
<p>I didn't really do real money gaming much as I knew that I often lost, except in one game in which I managed to earn around hundred rupees. I didn't do sports betting, rummy, poker as I didn't have enough knowledge, neither desire to gain it.</p>
<p>I must have earned a total 600-700 rupees overall, without any investment, but I then just stopped as the work to reward ratio was too low. But for me, the biggest feeling was earning something. I still remember that I playfully bantered with my classmates that I have already started earning, have more cash in my wallet than them, who had none.</p>
<p>I didn't share much about these platforms in my group, other than the Crypto currency platform, and Google Opinion Rewards, as many of these platforms were specific to India, and few required investments. And I used to say that, <q>I will make sure that my group members don't have to pay a single cent from their pocket</q> as a comparison to of other group admins or YouTubers.</p>
 
<h2
id="making-my-first-profit-from-cryptocurrencies-15---2021-06">Making
My First Profit From Cryptocurrencies (14 - 15)</h2>
<p> After learning programming for 1.5 years, at the age of 13.5, I created my own <a href="https://hstsethi.vercel.app/posts/lifestyle/lessons-learned-founding-internet-groups-memoir">group</a> for computer, cybersecurity related discussions, that gained over 100 members, and I started learning about finance, stocks, cryptocurrency.
 <p>At the age of 14, after I gained working knowledge of block chain,
cryptocurrencies and related fields, I started searching for ways to
implement my knowledge. I came across a platform named <a
href="https://stormgain.com">Stormgain</a> which had a feature that
would let you mine Bitcoin on their cloud platform for free. So I signed
up there and started mining.</p>
<p>I was able to refer around 5 people in Sethi Free Hacking School, which
increased my mining rate. Soon, I reached $10, the minimum withdraw
limit, and withdrew my earnings to my trading account, there was no
option to withdraw to bank account, crypto wallet. From that, I bought
Matic USDT and made $13.</p>

loading="lazy" alt="Stormgain screenshot with Matic USDT and $13 profit" /></p>
<p>But sadly, I wasn’t able to withdraw the profit because I didn’t have
legal documents, as I was a minor. After that, I just abandoned
Stormgain, cryptocurrencies and started focusing more on programming,
equities instead. Though still I did manage to make $105 profit in demo account with BTCUSDT and COMPUSDT </p>

<p>Even though it was a demo account, I played safe and only bought
securities which I would feel confident buying from my real money. I
also bought some cryptocurrencies including Dogecoin, Ethererum,
Bitcoin, but my main focus was on equities.</p>
<p>As of 2024-11-10, My abandoned account have 174 % profit, but it’s
just a demo account, so I can’t really withdraw it.</p>

<h2
id="earning-money-by-doing-in-game-micro-transactions-for-others">Earning
Money By Doing In-game Micro transactions for others (14 -
15.5)</h2>
<p>As I shared in my <a
href="https://hstsethi.vercel.app/posts/programming/reasons-i-am-not-gamedeveloper">previous
article</a> that why I am not a game developer and why I don’t play
video games, I was safe from this “disease”. But many of my friends did,
and they didn’t have much means to do in-game micro transactions as they
were minors too.</p>
<p>I had already opened a mini KYC Paytm account using my father’s documents, as I mentioned above,
and had knowledge of these things so I did micro transactions on their
behalf.</p>
<p>Most of micro transactions I did were in video game named <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Fire_(video_game)">Free
Fire</a>. I would buy a Google Play Gift card using my Paytm balance and
then share code with them. Sometimes, I also did direct top ups using <a
href="https://codashop.com">Codashop</a>.</p>

<p>I had started this at age of 14, but later stopped doing micro transactions altogether, due to bad debt with BD, and instead parked my money in FD. I also stopped going to his home as I was spending more in fuel. I had already earned lot of profit by arranging business deal between BD and my father at age of 11, so I gave up. </p>
<p>Since Paytm isn’t a traditional bank, I couldn’t go to a bank to get
money deposited. So, I would have to go to some mobile recharge shops,
and later a friend, who would take cash, commission from me and send to
my Paytm account. For this reason, I would charge some “commission”
too. Due to it not being a traditional bank, once a credit worth 4,500 was freezed. I did not have UPI and my friend did an UPI payment. It stuck there for 5 months until suddenly, at age 15, it was credited after hours of verifications and talks with customer care. </p>
<p>My opening balance at age 14 was around 1,500 rupees, but my closing balance,
at the end of age 15, was around <strong>16,000 rupees</strong>. While
I did loose around 500 as bad debts to two of my friends, including EC from C-1 who is described in Fanclub section of Leadership Autobiography. I then stopped
doing transactions for them. Overall, <strong>it was fun and
profitable!</strong></p>
<p>A boy(SM) who was 2 year older than me, 16, but shorter and also present when K slapped me, had discovered that I often carried cash to get deposited from my friend. He once tried to mug me near that place by blockingmy way and an unsucessfull arm bar. He was accompanied with another 16 year old boy who did not interfere much. After 10 minutes of resistance, I managed to push him down and run away. SM tried to grab my backpack to stop me from running, but he ended up stumbling again after the strap tore away. I did not give him any money, and he afterwards never dared to mess with me.</p> 
<p>Below is a chat screenshot from one of my friend. Translation He:
Hello, Harshit. Me: Yeah. He: Russian one. Me: Lol, yes. He: Do you have
money in Paytm? 700? Me: Yes He: Okay I will send you a number, send it
there. Me: Okay, send.</p>

<h2
id="starting-equity-trading-using-my-fathers-account-16---2024">Starting
Equity Trading Using My Father’s Account (16 - 18)</h2>
<p>At the age of 16, I finally managed to convince my father to open a
demat account for me. Earlier he was using multiple excuses including
how he lost so much money, “what if step mother discovered this”, “focus
on studies”, "invest in gold", and more. But when I showed him my demo account and
demonstrated my knowledge, he agreed. After extensive research, I choose
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerodha">Zerodha</a> as my
broker, because it was a discount broker, that charges less fees than
full-service ones. My father had initially opened an account on a
full-service broker, but after I explained him charges associated with
such brokers, he let me open account at Zerodha, using his
documents.</p>
<p>Within six months, I managed to <strong>earn 10% profit</strong> by
investing my savings into low expense ratio ETfs and few individual
stocks.</p>
<p>During this age, I also started learning about XMR(Monero). Specifically, it's algorithm and implementation. I experiminted with it's testnet network, mining etc. As screenshot below shows, I managed to get collect 10 XMR(Testnet). </p>

 <p>At age of 17, I started learning about various equity related strategies through paper trading, backtracking, refined mine one, moved from ETFs to individual stocks. Also reached around <strong>16% profit</strong>.</p>

 <h2 id="preaching-finance">Preaching Finance to Classmates, 17</h2>
<p>At the age of 17, after lot of explanations, fearmongering by me, one of obsessed classmate, from C-2C, created a demat account using his parents documents, just 3 months before final exams. He took accountancy homework very seriously, where I did not even care and was even basically exempt from it by teacher, allowed to only do examples. He wanted to pursue B. Com from Delhi University, one of most prestigious for business courses. Despite having reservations, he wasn't able to. Which makes what you will read further to be even more absurd.</p>
<p>He initially choose Groww and created account with his father's document, but I suggested him to switch to Zerodha, due to low expenses, and create account from someone with lower income tax slab rate, and he did. I had also gave him a rough idea of good blue chip stocks to invest in. He also took my advice, but ended up making a loss.</p>
<p>His first trade resulted in a loss. When he came to class the next day, he told me that he had accidentally sold it and will again buy it today. He then <strong>again did the same mistake.</strong></p>
<p>The next day he came to class and offered to drop me back home, I refused but he then said he wants to talk about stock market, so I kinda agreed. In the mid way, he started sharing what had happened to him, accusing Zerodha to be a scam company etc. But he couldn't even tell how much loss he made on each trade. He simply told me the difference between his initial capital and current one, which he did using calculator after in my presence.</p>
<p>Then I went through his accounts myself, in his phone, and quickly found the error in the tradebook. While the tradebook is deep buried in console, and UI isn't that friendly, an investor ought to have knowledge of platform before starting. As I suspected, he was doing intraday trades using MSI instead of Cash and Carry(CNC).  Due to which, he not only paid higher charges, but also suffered from market volatility. The first trade caused him a loss of around -500, the second he got slightly lucky and ended with ony -192 loss. I calculated these by myself by subtracting selling price from buying price, which may seem simple, but there was no UI which showed outcome of each trade, and he himself was confused by words like "LTP", "average price".</p>
<p>I then suggested him just to close his account. He said he will keep account just to check stock prices, but wouldn't trade. When I told him about AMC, he got shocked that expense also exists and then thanked me, asked me for account closure process. I directed him to Zerodha customer care, which he had around 20 minutes talk with. I didn't want to reveal my home location to him, so I told him to drop me at bus stand, a common destination, and then walked back home. Ultimately, even his offer to drop me didn't prove to be beneficial to me.</p>
<p>So in the end, he suffered a <strong>total loss around -1,000</strong> including 200 account opening charges, which was all preventable.</p>
<p>His fault was that he ignored the perquisites, and didn't do any research himself. The signs were clear: beta value was high, RSI was showing overbought and PE ratio was above 50. His first ever trade was done using real money, which you should never. Always start with paper trading. Despite being familar with financial ratios, balance sheet anysis from education, and doing thoussnds of questions on them, he did not even apply those concepts. He also didn't ask for my phone number, from me or anyone. All of our communication were in class. I could potentially help him earlier if he had messaged me. Though members of C-2A congratulated me for "causing" his loss.</p>

<p>Same classmate who is shown in screenshot above, requesting me to do 700 rupees micro transaction, asked my advice after investing in an IPO. After I told him that the industry he invested in has almost total monopoly, he sold those shares at a minor loss. My advice was provetd to be true as the stock fell after just few months of IPO. I had gained this knowledge by actually spending my time in a shop concerning such industry. I was familiar with what customers demanded and what fear mongering shopkeepers used.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="starting-equity-with-my-own-account-2024---present">Starting
Equity With My Own Account (18 - Present)</h2>
<p>From just a day next to my eighteenth’s birthday, I started preparing
for creating my demat account, because I knew that it would be a lengthy
process. I started by applying for pan card, which is necessary to
create a bank and equity account.</p>
<p>As soon as my Permanent Account Number(PAN) card got delivered to my
home, I went to bank with my father to get my account converted from a
joint minor account to personal savings account. It took around 2 weeks
for everything to get ready. After that, I created my own demat account
at Zerodha. Surprisingly, my account got activated within 48 hours but
now I had to transfer equities from my father’s account to my account.
It was again very lengthy process that involved creating accounts on
CDSL website, setting up beneficiary, verifying documents, but I again
managed to do it on my own. Sadly, this wasn’t the end.</p>
<p>After the securities got transferred to my account, I faced yet
another issue. The issue was that only number of shares were visible,
but their book value wasn’t visible.</p>
<p>After researching on internet, I found that it’s a <a
href="https://support.zerodha.com/category/trading-and-markets/kite-web-and-mobile/kite-error-messages/articles/discrepant-holdings">common
thing</a>. Now I had to manually enter the book value, date of purchase,
amount of each share. I initially became a bit worried on how would I
get that this data, as the shares were transferred from my father’s
account. I went through bank statements, chat logs, screenshots and
created a CSV file of all the transactions I could recover. To ease up
the process, I wrote a simple Python script to automatically calculate
average price of stocks and append it to CSV. But this wasn’t enough.
Not only the dataset was incomplete, but it also had some small
differences than book value of shares which were caused by various
charges including brokerage, tax.</p>
<p>Fortunately, when browsing through my father’s demat account, I found
a way to export old transaction history as CSV. I ran a modified version
of my script and created a clean CSV file.</p>
<p>But still, around 65 shares still had discrepancies. The UI and docs
were extremely unhelpful too. I ended up sharing my CSV to customer
support and they fixed my issue within 4 days. Interestingly, they also
admitted that there were indeed issues in backend.</p>

loading="lazy" alt="Zerodha staff admitting that there were issue"/></p>
<p>It took around 2 months in all this but after that I could enjoy the
fruit of freedom, my efforts. Soon, I also reached <strong>25% in
equity</strong></p>
<p><img

<p>Edit:1 Some "readers" from a technical analysis community have been arguing me that I should have sold
and rebought the shares, instead of transfering them, as transfering is
a long process. Well, If I had did what that then I would have to pay
additional tax, and also I would loose that 20%. If I had sold them,
then I would not be sitting on 25% profit and would not be writing this
article. Also they were telling me that I would not have to pay tax, as my income is low, but I was trading from my father account. If I had sold using his account, that would have caused tax liability. I thought it would be obvious hence, I did not clarify it. < /p>
<p>Edit2: Within a month of writing this article, I was able to double
my capital. I did this with combination of taking advantage of <q>Largest Con of Corporate history</q> by Adani, as reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/chair-indias-adani-group-indicted-united-states-2024-11-20">Reuters</a> even though I heard this news after closing of market,
different strategies and willpower. I am not going to hold Adani stock for a long time due to: extremely high PE; high equity to debt ratio; coal, cronyism etc. They, the readers mentioned in first
edit, used to say "A dip*** kid came here to flex his 25% profit on 35K
capital and how he saved on taxes ..." but I never cared much. If I had
been arguing with them, I would have never reached here. Below is my P/L
as of 2024-12-18. The small red is due to a stock is due to a single
stock, but overall it's all green. I will just book profit and sell it
ASAP, in fact I have placed a sell order already.</p>

 <h3 id="becoming-lakhpati">Becoming Self Made Equity Lakhpati In Bear Market, 18</h3>

 <p>Lakhpati means someone who has more than 100k rupees. I used this word instead of millionarie because the later implies USD. I have now changed the title of this article to simply "1.10k+" to be more clear. </p>
 <p>Despite the market conditions being bearish, Sensex down by <strong>3,000</strong> points, according to <a href=" https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-crash-bse-sensex-plunges-3000-points-in-9-sessions-are-indian-stock-markets-in-a-firm-bear-grip/articleshow/118323250.cms">Times Of India</a>. My profit % being down than earlier, 25, due to aggressive trading, I managed to reach my goal. It is an extremely difficult thing to reach this goal in bull run, but I did so that <strong> in Worst bear run since 29 years </strong>, as Reuters article linked below reports, and at age of 18, just 4 days before my first semester exams.
 <p>Edit3: 2025-02-15. I am extremely happy to announce that I have become a <strong>Self made, Equity Lakhpati</strong> in the bear market, by the age of 18, by having investments worth 1,00,000 Rupees at market value. </p>

<p>But unfortunately, since today is Saturday, I can't do the trade today, but I have placed a limit order worth 9,000 which will get executed on Monday. I already have 92,000 so even if it doesn't become green that time, I would still be Lakhpati. So basically nothing can stop me. I will upload the screenshot on Tuesday, because I just can't control my laughter today and also after delivery so that people don't say I did an intraday trade.</p>

<p>Also it looks like my decision to not hold Adani was yet another right one. Currently Adani is down again, and it's due to coal as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-enterprises-net-tanks-97-stock-down-3/articleshow/117765334.cms">Times of India Reports</a>. If I kept holding it, I would have not become a Lakhpati this soon.</p>

<p>Edit 4: 2025-02-17, turns out my another decision was correct, <strong>my premature celebration was not wrong</strong>. In the end, I had the last laughter, but it was not my last laughter. Not only my limit order got executed below the market price, but I am now sitting at 1% up in positions. I can technically sell it and be profitable, but I am going to wait for delivery. I have uploaded screenshot of positions on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hstsethi_lakhpati-selfmade-achievementspeaklouderthanwords-activity-7297111010820210688-e2Ho">Linkedin</a>. </p> 

<p>Edit 5: 2025-02-18. For those who like to keep a count, my yet another decision was correct. The market value of my portfolio is above 1L, even before opening of market, and below is a screenshot of my P/L as promised. </p>

<p>Edit 6: 2025-02-20, Adani stock is down again by 4.5% due to bribery
charges by USA, as <a

Of India</a> reports. A bit of old news as I don’t consume news and I
don’t have high expectations, unlike what high, artificially infalted,
PE ratio of company says.</p>

<p>Edit 7: 2025-03-03 Despite not studying at all, focusing on stock market, poor conditions, I was the <strong>first one in folllowing cases:</strong>to complete all of my first semester exams; announce the results are declared; discrepancies in them; help students in it. I completed all 5 exams, which were of 150 minutes, with <strong>M: 24.2, SD: 2.4 </strong> and SGPA of 7.6. See descriptive statistics, evidences in <a href="https://gist.github.com/hstsethi/be010e0d9e8a24b2b149bc8a77f1a1a5">this gist</a>. Also it looks like stock market is falling more with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-stocks-worst-run-29-years-wiping-1-trillion-wealth-may-yet-have-legs-2025-02-28">Reuters</a> describing it as <q>Worst run in 29 years</q>, but I still achieved my goals despite that. </p>
 <p>Edit 8: (2025-03-08) Despite the continued bear trend, I was able to take the trash out of my portfolio, free up capital. A limit sell order I had earlier placed has been executed. I did lot of mental calculations, even including transaction charges, managed my greed and set a value that will leave me with a net profit. I used the money from it, and some additional to invest in a good stock. Now even my investment value is more than1 Lakh. I didn't invest too much as I also have to pay college fee too. If I had set GTT high, it wouldn't be executed and I wouldn't be able to take advantage of current bear market. Now I also have one less company to worry about. </p>
