<h1>I Completed Hacktoberfest 2024. Here is What I Loved and
Hated</h1>
<section id="content">

<p>Hacktoberfest 2024 was my first Hacktoberfest. While I joined at
the middle of the event, I managed to complete this challenge
before the end of event.</p>
<p>My 6 pull requests were accepted into Hacktoberfest, including 4
of them which are in top 5 most starred projects: “Free Programming
Books”, “Best Websites A Programmer Should Visit”.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-hated">What I Hated</h2>

<h2 id="what-i-loved">What I Loved</h2>

achieve my goal by reviewing my commits, giving genuine and clear
feedback.</p>
