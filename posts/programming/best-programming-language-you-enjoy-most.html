<h1>What is the Best Programming Language? The One You Enjoy the
Most</h1>
<p>What is a programming language? What is the best programming
language? What programming language should I learn? These are the
questions often asked by new programmers. In this post, I will try
to give an answer to these questions and help you choose the "best"
programming language.</p>
<p>With so many programming languages, methodologies, frameworks,
how can one choose a specific one to use? Apart from few domain
specific ones, most of them accomplish the same task, just in a
different way. They are just tools used to get something done.</p>
<h2>Programming Lahguages are just Tools</h2>
<p>If most of the tools accomplish the same task then why put
effort in choosing a specific tool? Just choose one with most
demand at the moment, or one that looks most "easy".</p>
<p>Well, its not that simple. Everyone is unique. One tool may work
for one but may not work for the another one. One may be productive
in a particular tool while the other may not be. Some may like
descriptive languages while some may prefer concise ones. There are
so many other factors, but It just boils down to personal
preferences of the user.</p>
<h2>How to choose the best programming language?</h2>
<p>Choosing the right tool for the right job will surely do
increase productivity, but what will increase it even more?
Interest in the tool you are using.</p>
<p>Programming languages are used in lot of different fields. Be it
web development, hardware, fintech, artificial intelligence, web
scrapping and you name it. So the first step will be to see what
field do you like the most. I recommend you to take this decision
wisely. You can refer to introductory material on these fields or
look for some open source projects on them and try to ask yourself,
"what problems do they solve and how?". Don't forget to actually
try them yourself by writing few toy programs.</p>
<p>Now have you choose a field? Great now what tool to use? As I
mentioned above, there are lot of different tools and almost all of
them do the same thing. Lets take an example of web-development.
There are lot of frameworks for frontend side and in backend side
you can use literally any programming language. Now the choice is
yours. Do you like statically typed language, faster runtime speed?
There are many options like Go, Rust, C++, Java etc. Do you like
dynamically typed languages, faster development speed? There are
too many options like Python, JavaScript, Ruby etc. This list just
never ends. Its important that you <strong>choose what you like the
most</strong>.</p>
<p>Since we are talking about the best programming language, it makes sense to talk about the best distro too. The same "rule" applies here. The best distro is one you enjoy the most. But the problem arises when majority of the distro are exactly the same. Majority of programs will work same on all of the distros. The only differences are wallpaper, DE, which I won't use anyway. Another difference is the package manager, but that's minor too.</p>

<p>Hence I find the idea of arguing about the best distro to be **even more pointless** than arguing about the best programming language. I just use distro which are secure, minimalist and don't get into my way. I don't use Arch, Gentoo BTW.</p>


<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<p><code>Disclaimer: Everything in this section is my personal
opinion based on personal experience. I am not trying to promote or
shame any technology.</code></p>
<p>I worked on C++ for more than a year, made 3+ projects before I realized it isn't for
me. Some people still ask me <q>Why is it written in C++ instead of in X </q>. I tell them that I was in my "C++ phase" back then, but now I have gotten out. Few things that I didn't like about C++ were:</p>
<ul>
<li>No standardized build system</li>
<li>Multiple inheritance</li>
<li>Template abuse</li>
<li>Having to grind in Valgrind for finding memory related
bugs</li>
<li>Over dependence of stdlib and STL on exceptions</li>
<li>Header files </li>
</ul>
It was okay for small to medium projects, but as soon I started
using on big projects, I started feeling unproductive. 
<p>After completing <a href="https://github.com/hstsethi/dietcli">DietCLI project</a>, I started researching more about
alternative programming languages. Since I had already made my mind
on what fields to avoid, it wasn't much hard for me to narrow down
the available options. The fields that I usually avoid are:
embedded hardware, mobile development, <a href="https://hstsethi.vercel.app/posts/programming/reasons-i-am-not-gamedeveloper"> game development</a> Though again it's my own
opinion. You should also make your own list.</p>
<p>I came across many options but I choose two of them: Go and
Rust. Both looked good to me. Statically typed, compiled, fast and
safe. I started with Go first and made <a href="https://github.com/hstsethi/peartok-go">PearTok</a> project in it.
Soon, I realized that its too verbose for my needs and stopped
using it. It was a different kind of verbosity as most of the
verbosity comes from error handling, same lines were repeated everywhere.
</p>
<p> Then I moved to AI engineering. After that I never looked back. I wish I had made
this decision earlier and shouldn't haven't wasted time in
mastering things I don't enjoy.</p>
<p>So I would just like to end this article by saying that you
should take your time when choosing what tool to use. I am not
saying that you should stay rigid at a particular tool. I am saying
that you should notice patterns of what things you are most
productive with. It could be anything. Static, dynamic, OOP,
functional, verbose, concise or even a combination of them.</p>
