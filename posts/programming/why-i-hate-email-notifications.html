<h1>Why I Hate Receiving Email Notifications And How I manage
them</h1>
<p>Majority of people think that email notifications are for
increasing productivity of the users, but in reality, they are
there for bringing users back to their product.</p>
<p>Email Notifications can be divided into two categories based on
their source, the one that comes from sources which are frequently
accessed, the one that aren't.</p>
<h2>Notification from Products Which Frequently Accessed</h2>
<p>I really hate receiving notifications from the products which
are frequently accessed for various reasons including duplication,
high frequency of such emails which shadows important content.</p>
<p>Some of the worst offenders under this categories are GitHub,
Linkedin, Zerodha, National Stock Exchange(NSE), Bombay Stock
Exchange(BSE).</p>
<p>The last three send emails notifications about the balance in my
trading account. But why would anyone want to get that information
over email. Stock prices change every second. They send that email
weekly, that makes it even more outdated and useless.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<h2>Notifications From Products Which Are Not Frequently
Accessed</h2>
<p>I do not hate them as much. They can be good but it really
depends on the context.</p>
<p>Monthly email digest about niche blogs, TOS and privacy policy
updates are okay in my opinion but again it depends on the
context.</p>
<h2>How I Manage Email Notifications</h2>
<p>I start by not signing up on any unnecessary platforms, using
aliases.</p>
<p>For my professional life, I use Outlook email. The reason I
choose it because it has IMAP, rules based filtering, good spam
filter, high reputation, and I would be really providing my data to
Microsoft through GitHub, Linkedin. I use NeoMutt as my email
client, Neovim as a text editor along with gh-cli, and gpg. While
GitHub provides an option to reply to issues, pulls through email
but I did not find that workflow productive. My whole setup is "no
frills". You can find my dotfiles, manifesto on my, <a href=
"https://github.com/hstsethi/no-frills-dotfiles/">GitHub
repository</a></p>
<p>So here are my thoughts about types of email notifications I
hate. But I would like to share that I do not hate all email
notifications. There are many of them which I eagerly wait for,
such as those sent by readers of my website, confidential messages
which are properly encrypted with my <a href=
