<h1>Awesome J2ME: An Awesome List About Everything Related to
J2ME</h1>
<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction to J2ME</h2>
<a href=
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Micro_Edition">Java
ME</a>, also known as J2ME, is a Java specification for old keypad
phones and PDAs.</section>

<h2>About Awesome J2ME</h2>
<p>Introducing Awesome J2ME<a href=
"https://github.com/hstsethi/awesome-j2me">Awesome J2ME</a>, an
Awesome list that I have been working on for
more than a year. The goal of this project is to create a
comprehensive resource that will be helpful to the whole community.
Not only developers, video gamers, hobbyists but anyone who is
interested in J2ME.</p>
<p>I managed to collect a diverse set of resources, and submit a
<a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/pull/3115">pull
request</a> that passed all the checks in first try. But sadly, due
to small community size, most communities being hosted on proprietary platforms, lack of resources, exams and abandonment
of J2ME by Oracle, I was not able to completely fulfill my
goal.</p>
<p>So I would like to request you to help me in achieving this
goal. Pull requests are always welcome. If you canâ€™t think of any
good resource, simply sharing and giving it a star on Github is
more than enough.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
