<h1>5 Reasons Why I Am Not a Game Developer</h1>
<p>Working in a video game industry must be a dream job of many
people. What could be better than getting paid to play, test or
create video games? Sadly, life is not a bed of roses. Reality is
far worse than it. Below I present five personal reasons, backed by
both rational and empirical evidence, on why I am not a video game
developer or a video gamer.</p>
<h2>Unproductive</h2>
<p>How many real life problem do majority of video games solve?
<strong>Zero</strong>. While some might argue that video games are
source of entertainment and happiness, I would like to clarify that
video games aren't the only source of entertainment and certainly
not the "best" one.</p>
<p>Happiness can be obtained from productive things like learning
new skills, physical activities, self
improvement and many more. These activities not only provide
entertainment, but they also have a productive outcome. It's like
the best of the both world.</p>
  <p>There is a genre of video games called Sandbox Simulation, whose titles, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Powder_Toy">The Powder Toy</a>, claim to be educational video games, but I find that claim to be a marketing tactic for many reasons: science is more than just alchemy; the experiments in them are not isolated; there is no way to get the value of and control variables such as time, temperature, density, atomic mass, volume, mass and more; oversimplification of scientific concepts; promoting a brute force approach to knowledge gain. </p>
  <p>It should be noted that I'm criticizing video games, not educational softwares like CAD, physics simulators etc. They are neither video games, nor marketed as such.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Expensive To Produce</h2>
<p>Not surprising that it's almost impossible to find a single
person who is proficient in all aspects of game development. A team
of multiple professionals is required for game development. Not
just programmers, but writers, animators, artists, actors and
more.</p>
<p>Such diverse and unusual requirements make it expensive, and
hard to produce a video game. Not to mention that maintaining
coordination and unity among such diverse set of skills is almost
impossible. A programmer may not knowledgable about art. An artist
may not be knowledgeable about programming. Yet they are still
expected to coordinate and deliver the product within a strict
deadline.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Not Much Profitable</h2>
<p>As video games don't solve any real life problem, require
diverse set of skills, have a high capital requirement, its obvious
that they aren't much profitable. According to <a href=
"https://vginsights.com/insights/article/analysis-of-games-launched-in-2022-so-far">
VGInsights,</a> <strong>80% of video game developers have gross
lifetime income of less than $5,000</strong></p>

alt=
"Pie chart that reads: 80%: Less than $5,000. 5%: 5,000-10,000." />
<hr />
<h2>Unethical</h2>
<p>Video games are addictive, aren't they? Why wouldn't they be
when developers spend years in making them "better". To make them
even more addictive, video game industries have started using
various unethical means like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Openly sexualizing anything they can</li>
<li>Including violent content</li>
<li>Forcing players to spend real money on micro transactions which
have no real-life worth</li>
<li>Harboring toxic communities.</li>
</ul>
All of this for what? <a href=
"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30846962">To make people
violent</a>, addicted and to make them waste their hard earned
money on their virtual products and services.
<p>The development side isn't very good either. Overtime, low pay,
unreasonable demands, strict deadlines are a common thing
there.</p>
<p>“It is not really an industry that treats people well. It’s not
an industry that is stable or well-paid. It’s also an industry that
has tons and tons of supply and not a lot of demand. So it’s not
the most ideal place to work." - <a href=

<hr />
<h2>Personal Preference</h2>
<p>I am a "hedonist". I do what I enjoy the most. As I discussed in
my previous <a href=
"best-programming-language-you-enjoy-most">post</a>, one should
choose the programming language that he enjoys working with the
most. Same thing can be applied here. I don't like playing or
making video games, so I don't do it. Being hedonist a doesn't mean
that I have to derive pleasure from things I am not passionate

<p> Edit 1: Today(2024-12-25), is the day of Christmas, and I had some free time. So I was going through my list of video games that I have played. I refactored the list and added few entries which I forgot earlier. One thing I observed that, 
I have played 30 PC games. Out of which, I deleted 28 within 30 minutes of installing. Rest 2, Assassins Creed: Brotherhood, and Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, I played for 2 hours at max. I also did bit "cheating" through saving game at short intervals. I also have experience doing in-game micro transactions for others, as I described in my <a href="posts/finance/from-coins-to-25-equity-at-18">financial autobiography</a>. I am making this edit just to let readers know that I'm not hating on video games without even trying them. </p> 
out or things that do not have a productive outcome.</p>
<hr />
<p>I would once again like to remind that I'm not saying, "Don't be
a game developer". I am just sharing my personal opinion.</p>
