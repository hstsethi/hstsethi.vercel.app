<p>Vim, or NeoVim, is the text editor that I am sure almost every
tech savvy person must have heard of. Though only few people use it
on daily basis. I don't blame them. It can be intimidating, hard at
first. In this post, I will highlight some native features of Vim
which I believe, that other command line editors and IDEs lack.</p>

<p>Working in a video game industry must be a dream job of many
people. What could be better than getting paid to play, test or
create video games? Sadly, life is not a bed of roses. Reality is
far worse than it.Reasons: Unproductive, expenesive to produce, not
much profitable, unethical, personal prefrence.</p>

Receiving Email Notifications And How I manage Them</a> -
<time datetime="2024-10-20">2024-10-20</time></li>
<p>Majority of people think that email notifications are for
increasing productivity of the users, but in reality, they are
there for bringing users back to their product. Email Notifications
can be divided into two categories based on their source, the one
that comes from sources which are frequently accessed, the one that
aren't.</p>
