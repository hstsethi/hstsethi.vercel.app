~~HstSethi's personal website's source code~~

The source code of the website was once hosted here for almost a year. Then this repository remained private for a while, and comment section remained broken, before the code was migrated to a private repository and relinked with Vercel. 

The commit log has been purged, Vercel integration has been revoked. This exact repository was preserved, because of the issues created here serve as a comments section, and changing URLs of such would have been more tedious.

I am working on other ways to provide the source code that does not involve open sourcing entire commit log. Most likely periodically releasing tarballs.
