It <q>Returns HTML of random account from short-autobiography and renders it.</q></p>

    <p id="age-1">Before the age of 2, there isn't anything much I can talk about.
It's mostly really negative experiences which I won't share. Other
than that I managed to survive a feral cat bite that happened when
I was in crib. I started education at just 1.5 by going to a
childcare until admissions opened. </p>
  
<p id="age-2"> At the age of 2, I ran away from
a school before taking admission into pre-nursery at another
school.  </p> 
  <p id="age-3">At the age of 3, I had to do pre-nursery again in another
school, which ate my "early bird advantage" and dragged me down to
those who started at "normal age".  
Learned about technology including installing third party apps, Bluetooth, web browsing etc. I also collected stones a bit but later stopped in favor of plants. Also learned writing in English, Hindi, Punjabi, sorted in order of proficiency that time. </p>
<p id="age-4">At age of 4, I did my first shallow water swim. Expanded my knowledge of technology, using only J2ME phones and slow internet connection. I utilized various methods including overnight, bulk downloads and keeping device in open area. Started teaching myself English. I learned it
through many sources including newspapers, books, writing, reading
a dictionary, watching non-fiction television channels including
History TV 18, Discovery, Animal Planet, Nat Geo etc. </p>
<p id="age-5">At the age of 5, I started <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/hstsethi-note-collection_v5avho.jpg">
collecting coins, notes</a> and got my first gold medal in overall
academics, which was also first possible gold medal as before that, there were no awards. Almost amputated my finger while trying to open an electronic with a knife. I still have wound of this.  </p>
<p id="age-6">At the age of 6, I got <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/v1734071591/silver-medal-sof-with-age-6-gold-medal_vng5vt.jpg">
another gold medal</a>, gave my first public speech at school, was
forced to play a role into school annual function and continued
coin collection. 
Started climbing trees and practicing jumping. It should be noted that I did not jump out of sake of it, but for a practical necessity, such as travel, retrieving ball, playing hide and seek etc. I employed proper techniques such as hanging to reduce distance. I also did not try rolling or back flip, despite an unsolicited advice of a self proclaimed expert, because I knew a roll technique he was teaching could break the neck, which is way worse than breaking limbs; my jumps weren't really that high which warranted a roll; possibility of pebbles on ground.</p>
<p id="age-7">At the age of 7, I learned about firecraft including firepit, boiling, roasting plant material, pottery, blacksmithing(didn't practice due to improper equipment), realizing that dry leaves aren't really dry. Served
as discipline manager for whole academic session, started long
distance cycling(total 10Km + a day), despite being underweight(BMI < 13)</p>
<p id="age-8">At the age of 8, I started teaching myself basic theoretical electricity. I wrote my
<a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/how-mk-electrical-formula-nb.jpg">
own note</a> titled <q>How to Make Electric Formulas</q>. Convinced my parents to stop sending me to tuitions which led to increase in grades, freedom, decrease in costs. I <strong>haven't taken any tuition since then</strong>.</p>
<p id="age-9">At the age of 9, I started focusing more on stationery, software side of
technology. Won a mental maths quiz and an
English poem recitation competition in school. Started volunteering
by counting, curating donations at a temple, where my father held
voluntary managerial position.</p>
<p id="age-10">By the age of 10, I had shaped my interest in finance,
technology, felids/nature, stationery collection. I had negative
experience with all of them but <strong>that didn't stop
me.</strong> Rather they had an opposite effect. I started taking
my stationery collection seriously. I also introduced this hobby,
trading, written communication using obscure words, tabletop games,
hidden pockets and bills to my classmates. I had <strong>collected
227 sharpeners, over 150 pens</strong> through both trading,
purchasing and deterring thieves on the basis of that maths teacher
considered me her "favorite student", gave me <q>Smart and Cool
:smile:</q> on <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/smart-cool-rc-10_fmradg.jpg">
official report card.</a>. I also played the front role in school
annual function, again forcefully admitted, but had privilege of
being only student excluded from makeup(skin whitening powder),
because I am already pale, and wearing my own jacket(because
according to teachers it looked good). Also scored
96/100 in environmental science, A1 in oral exams of all 3 languages, despite being forced to take Sanskrit, instead of Punjabi, till age 13, due to lack of choice by school. </p>
<p id="age-11">At the age of 11, I gave up on stationery collection and also
personally donated it to poor students who passed an oral test.
Debunked the existence of paranormal beings, a popular topic of
discussion, by writing a note employing both philosophical and
scientific arguments. Forced to do another role, of a camel herder and coconut seller, but my partner considered the role of camel "inferior", <strong>falsely accused</strong> me of "favoritism", hence he did not come on that day, so I had to herd a random, costumesless student which prevented us from winning. Served as discipline manager, first bencher, time tracker for whole session of maths class. Because maths teacher, different from previous one, didn't have a watch and considered me her favorite student. Also helped her in a business deal with my father. I also started writing small bat scripts
using Exagear, Wine layer for Android.</p>
<p id="age-12">At the age of 12, I began teaching myself basics of Linux,
Programming and cybersecurity, and started using it for my day to day computing needs and
for automating repetitive tasks. Started from Java, but switched to Python a month later. I used Termux because I didn't have a
computer. Received <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/v1734071591/silver-medal-sof-with-age-6-gold-medal_vng5vt.jpg">
silver medal from Science Olympiad Foundation.</a> Got featured in front page of school magazine, not for medal. Avoided getting bitten by a rabid dog by kicking it and washing off saliva from trousers.</p>
<p id="age-13">At the age of 13, I started <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/gta-sa-mob-mod-menu_iitddh.jpg">
making mods</a> for GTA: SA mobile version. While I did not like
video games, music back then either, but I liked tinerking. It had
huge set of resources and it was possible to create mods without a
computer. I created my <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/2020-12-17-sethi-hacking-school-virus_os44ww.jpg">
own group</a> for computer, cybersecurity related discussions, that
gained <strong>over 100 members</strong>, and I started learning about finance,
stocks, cryptocurrency. Scored 88/100 in science(bio, chem, phy), despite being forced Sanskrit again with an unfavorable male teacher, who broke the "streak of favoritism", by unfairly targeting me. </p>
<p id="age-14">At the age of 14, I bought my own phone, for online classes, after plenty of research, and debloated, customized it on first day. I started a YouTube channel. I closed it after
I got strike on a video where I taught how to make and execute
prank bat "viruses" on Android using Exagear and <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/yt-video-strike_zivrrk.jpg">
another strike</a> for using copyrighted SFX in my botany video. Taking advantage of Covid-19 lockdown, resumed daily, long distance cycling, continued <strong>despite accident with a car</strong>. Made a profit of around <a href=
"httpinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/2021-05-18_stormgain-matic-usdt-trade_fwmwpf.jpg">
$13 in cryptocurrency</a>, and another <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/demo-105-crypto-stormgain_ciiik5.jpg">
$105 in crypto</a> demo account, but as I was a minor at that time,
I was not able to withdraw it. So I started focusing more on
programming, trading equities in demo account.</p>
<p id="age-15">At the age of 15, I created <strong>three groups</strong> and my
own <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/v1733216317/cybergeek-tg-bot_c3unth.jpg">
Telegram Bot</a>, introduced weekly non-fiction reading threads. One on <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/2021-07-10_mhpc-group-leave-announcement_byhynf.png">
Telegram</a> for computer and cryptocurrency discussion that gained
<strong>over 150 members and 50 more</strong> from collabration with a Russian
group. Another one on my own private web chat platform, 9 members all female. Another one on Signal, for teaching my classmates. Made my
<a href="https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/pull/1049">first pull
request</a> in open source project, and also did <a href=
"https://github.com/fmhy/edit/pull/9">very first contributions</a>,
<strong>pull request number 9, 10</strong> to Free Media Heck Yeah Project. Started, with opening balance 1,500,
earning by facilitating in-game micro transactions for others with closing balance of 10,000.
Started learning about internet privacy and security. After gaining
enough knowledge about it, I began taking steps to protect myself
including purging all my identities, groups, accounts, turning off
JavaScript, LUKS full disk encryption, using a VPN 24X7, though I used it earlier too but not always on. 
Bought a used, dead, 32 bit, 1 Gb ram computer and solely repaired, upgraded, fine tuned it to purpose as daily driver. Scored 90/100 in grade 10 English(Advanced).</p>
<p id="age-16">Age of 16 was true transitory period unlike 17, I set earlier. I started relearning about nature, wilderness
and preparedness. Including organizing my Every Day Carry(EDC),
supplies in machine readable JSON format, standardizing dates, format of notes, journal, encrypted cloud backups using Rclone, identifying local flora,
fauna, creating a <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/primitve-compass-ground_f93fb1.jpg">
primitive compass</a> using only <strong>one stick, two
pebbles</strong> and astronomical knowledge. Learned about major Abrahamic religions, local cults, philosophy, mathematics(modified SDL approach), nutriton, pharmacy. Did my first lacto-fermentation, of Solanum Nigrum. Wrote a <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/types-of-liquid-notes_h8uqpr.jpg">note</a> categorizing fluids on based of their relationship with heat and force based of previous experiements. Convinced my father to
open an equity trading account for me, and I started investing my
savings into low expense-ratio ETfs and few individual stocks. In
less than 6 months, I was able to make a <strong>profit of around
10%.</strong> Uploaded my first project, <a href=
"https://github.com/hstsethi/pytenpass">a password manager</a>, my

about reverse engineering, electrical engineering through use of simulators. Most of my reverse engineering projects
were done in Windows XP, DOS, some in <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/macos-9-sheep-shaver-cg_i0evdy.png">
Mac OS 9.</a> As seen in the <a href=
"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkgunni5p/image/upload/xp-office-97-re_txmdhl.png">
screenshot</a>, I managed to bypass the key verification of MS
Office 97 <strong>only by using Borland Turbo</strong> and Notepad in Windows XP.
Other things I reverse engineered are old J2ME software, firmware
for my Awesome J2ME project, Android apps for removing unnecessary
bloatware, permissions. Became favorite student again, of multiple teachers, despite completely new teachers, subjects, students, and other school relationships which I won't detail. Scored <strong>95/100</strong> in grade 11

how I feel about them, in favor of a holistic approach, including improving my method of mindfulness meditation, diet, which
worked to a great extent.  Despite that, I bought a custom built
laptop, and customized it further. Switched to wet shaving with a double edged razor, instead of cartridge. Created <a href=

<hr>
<p>While this autobiography may give a picture that my life is a
bed of roses, it's far far from truth. I have faced, and still
face, many challenges, but, just like personal successes, I have
not mentioned them here, even though they could amplify my success,
and raise donations. Because: I don't see any merit in crying or
swiping the victim card; I don't wish to traumatize people; it is
hard to explain objectively; this site is SFW; my challenges are
also a reason behind my success. While I do mention some important ones, I stress on how I overcame them.</p>
<p>Some people have asked me, how did I write this autobiography?
Is it all from memory? The answer is not a simple one.</p>
<p>As this autobiography is a result of connecting, fact-checking
thousands of sources. I have used my own memory, a lot of sources,
and shared many as "proofs" whenever feasible. My other sources are
asking others, my old handwritten written material, my notes, journal, todo list,
school awards, topics of books, screenshots, chat logs, recordings, bookmarks, bank
history, browser history, OSINTing myself, digital forensics, config and data files, legal
documents etc.</p>
<p>But few of sources have been lost with time. One such source was
a magazine which my school published, on which I was featured on
multiple times. Some of my digital sources were lost after I
realized the importance of internet privacy at age of 15.</p> 
<p>Still think my autobiography is fake? Well you can challenge me and win rewards. 100 rupees for proving any of my claim false(Did not happen at all), 150 rupees for proving the opposite of what is claimed, ie net loss instead of net profit. Public apology and your name will be permanently listed here. This only applies to this article, not to any other opinion, idea expressed by me.</p>
<p>All claims must contain the following metadata: year, evidence, how you obtained the evidence, why you think it's false. </p>

<p>Failure to adhere to any of the requirement will permanently disqualify you. You can make unlimited claims, hence earn unlimited money,  but getting your two claims proved wrong will also permanently disqualify you. </p>


<p>That was just a start. I strongly believe in <a href=
"#footnote-2">self directed[^2]</a>, lifelong learning. I am
continuously learning new things, learning from my previous
mistakes. I do not solely focus on technology and finance. I also
do have knowledge of various other topics including
philosophy(epistemological skepticism, <a href="#footnote-3">truth,
aesthetics as spectrum[^3]</a> naturism, asceticism(as a means to
end, not the end in itself), pragmatism, <a href=
"https://hstsethi.vercel.app/posts/philosophy/nature-achievements">individual
and objective achievements</a>, existentialism, political
philosophy), psychology, nature(preparedness, wilderness, first
aid, botany, felids), biology(evolutionary, nutrition), business,
culture(genealogy, language, history, religion).</p>
<p>Things I dislike<a href="footnote-4">[^4]</a> are: Fiction(art, <a href=
"posts/programming/reasons-i-am-not-gamedeveloper">video games</a>,
music, movies, "true" crime, documentaries, novels, self-help,
...). Consumerism(foodism<a href="#footnote-5">[^5]</a>, pet culture, modern web, <a href=
"posts/programming/why-i-hate-email-notifications">email
notifications</a>, news, psychoactive substances, ...). Irrational behaviour(anti-intellectualism, profanity, <a href="https://hstsethi.vercel.app/posts/lifestyle/why-i-dont-argue-on-internet-or-with-fools">arguing on the internet or with fools</a>, inherent or group based inferiority or superiority...)</p>

<p id="footnote-1">Felids do not just refer to domestic cats.
Felids refer to any genera within <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_felids">felidae family</a>.
I used this word, instead of "cat", because many people were
confused. I do not just admire domestic cats, I am more intereseted
in studying all genera within felidae family, including <em>Felis,
Acinonyx, Panthera</em>, and their respective species, from a
biological perspective, in their natural habitat. This is one of
the many reasons I do not have pets. My another reason is that I don't have access to meat.</p>

<p id="footnote-2">Self Directed Learning(SDL) means not following
any fixed roadmap, syllabus, instructions of someone. It is
inherently open ended, curiosity, skepticism driven and subjective.
It can not be taught, as building blocks of it like curiosity,
critical thinking abilities, IQ are innate. For example, Wikipedia
rabbit hole, exploring an unknown environment, my approach of SDL
where I do not read much books, watch courses, follow a roadmap, or
practice isolated or repeated set of exercises. Instead, I first
mediate on the topic. Then I seek relevant literature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="footnote-3">Truth, aesthetics both exist on a spectrum,
because our senses are not perfect. They are neither exclusively
objective or subjective, they are both. It depends on the context
and claim which is being made.</p>
</li>
  <li><p id="footnote-4">I consider the idea of absolutely hating a thing to be anti-intellectualism. It is very rare to hate all aspects of a thing. I have tried or studied about everything I dislike. Even for the things I dislike, there are few things in them which I admire. Additionally, the above list is a list of things I dislike, not what I want government to ban, or people to start disliking too.</p></li>
  <li><p id="footnote-5">While I dislike onion, garlic, ketchup, spices, and condiments, I don't consider myself a "picky eater", but a <strong>rational eater</strong>. I eat food only to fulfill my nutritional needs, even if it's not considered tasty.</p>
</ol>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Despite facing so much physical and mental trauma, I have not experienced any major setbacks. Zero bones broken, no burns, dog bites, loss of consciousiness, hospital admits, major food poisonings, all limbs, finger intact. Though I would still like to warn readers to be cautious. <strong>Maintain your distance</strong> from unknown plants, animals, surroundings and humans.</p></li>
 <li><p>
I never focused much on academics. Yet, I was able to score high, gain gold medals, win quizzes, become favorite student of multiple teachers, was always the first one to complete exams. There were some rumors, nicknames, that my classmates spread, along with jumping up on me in groups a few times, that my connections with teacher helped in that, but they couldn't explain how I scored on exams checked by external teachers. Or a top bookworm said that I intentionally did not write correct answers. Or I cheated in exams, but the nearby students were themselves dependent on me. Or that I bathe with milk, impact of feral cat bite. But as always, I did not care.
