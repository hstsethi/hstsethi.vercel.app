<p>Hello! Welcome to my personal website. I am Harshit Sethi. I am
a 19 year old, second semester student. A self Made AI,
Data, Equity Enthusiast(Cap. 1.10k+ INR at 18). In my free time, I like to document nature(especially
<a href="#footnote-1">felids[^1]</a>, wild plants). Localize open source projects on Weblate. Read and write
non-fiction literature on a various topics, including my own
works, while employing <a href="#footnote-2">SDL[^2]</a>. And lot of other things. </p>
<p>The Short Autobiography was a summary of my autobiographies. It covered achievements of every single year since age of 1. I found it hard to maintain and lacking in depth, so I have redacted it from public view. Instead, I let my present achievements speak for my past achievements. After all, achievements speak louder than words, and I could not have achieved what I have now in one day. The two other categories are best described in "Financial", and "Leadership" autobiography, respectively. Rest of relevant entries, mostly related to programming, from what once was <cite>Short Autobiography</cite> are quoted below. </p> 

<p>At the age of 5, I learned about technology including installing third party apps,
Bluetooth, web browsing etc, through a Symbian device. Utilized
various methods including overnight, bulk downloads and keeping
device in open area. Almost amputated my finger while trying to open an electronic
with a knife. Received gold medal for scoring highest in our class. </p>
<p>At age of 11, I started writing small bat scripts using Exagear, Wine layer for Android. Replaced old, internet-less keypad phone, from age 7, with 3G, J2ME device, and continued self-learning.</p>
<p>At the age of 12, I began teaching myself basics of Linux,
Programming and cybersecurity, and started using it for my day to
day computing needs and for automating repetitive tasks. Started
from Java, but switched to Python a month later. I used Termux
because I didn't have a computer. Received <a href=

silver medal from Science Olympiad Foundation</a>. The photo linked is with the gold medal from age 5. </p>

<h2>About This Website</h2>
<p>This site was created by me at age 18 from the ground up, without any template
or static site generator, with strong emphasis on privacy and
minimalism. It is 100% open source(Content: CC-BY-SA-NC, Code: Apache). It doesn't uses
JavaScript, cookies, unnecessary media and is free from
advertisements, trackers and pop-ups. It works perfectly even
without CSS. Here I post about technology, finance, lifestyle,
philosophy and related things.</p>
<p>Everything here is Safe For Work(SFW). I will never use
profanity or include NSFW media.</p>
<p>I created my logo with a simple paint application at the age of 17. I tried in other software like Inkspace, Gimp but couldn't get desired result. The "h" in logo is small case, so it looks like a chair. "S" is big, upper case so it looks like a monitor directly in front of "h". Overall, it makes it camelCase.</p>

<p id="footnote-1">Felids do not just refer to domestic cats.
Felids refer to any genera within <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_felids">felidae family</a>.
I used this word, instead of "cat", because many people were
confused. I do not just admire domestic cats, I am more intereseted
in studying all genera within felidae family, including <em>Felis,
Acinonyx, Panthera</em>, and their respective species, from a
biological perspective, in their natural habitat. This is one of
the many reasons I do not have pets. My another reason is that I
don't have access to meat. Currently I have 6 wild plant specimens contributions. Out of which, 4 are toxic. 3 toxic one's have <strong>Research Grade</strong> label.</p>

<li><p id="footnote-2">Self Directed Learning(SDL) means not following
any fixed roadmap, syllabus, instructions of someone. It is
inherently open ended, curiosity, skepticism driven and subjective.
It can not be taught, as building blocks of it like curiosity,
critical thinking abilities, IQ are innate. For example, Wikipedia
rabbit hole, exploring an unknown environment, my approach of SDL
where I do not read much books, watch courses, follow a roadmap, or
practice isolated or repeated set of exercises. Instead, I first
mediate on the topic. Then I seek relevant literature, especially
review articles.</p>
