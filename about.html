<p>Hello! Welcome to my personal website. I am Harshit Sethi. I am
a 18 year old, first semester, college student, a self-taught AI,
Data Enthusiast, Equity Trader, Technical Writer. Currently, I am
working on improving my AI skills, my website, projects, equity
portfolio. In my free time, I like to document nature(especially
<a href="#footnote-1">felids[^1]</a>, wild plants), read
non-fiction literature on a various topics, including my own
works.</p>
<section id="about-website">
<h2>About This Website</h2>
<p>This site was designed from the ground up, without any template
or static site generator, with strong emphasis on privacy and
minimalism. It is 100% <a href=
"https://github.com/hstsethi/hstsethi.vercel.app">open
source</a>(Content: CC-BY-SA-NC, Code: Apache). It doesn't uses
JavaScript, cookies, unnecessary media and is free from
advertisements, trackers and pop-ups. It works perfectly even
without CSS. Here I post about technology, finance, lifestyle,
philosophy and related things.</p>

profanity or include NSFW media.</p>

<h2>Short Autobiography</h2>
<section id="short-autobiography">
<p>The original Short Autobiography, on about page, was getting too
long, hence it has been moved to it's <a href="posts/lifestyle/short-autobiography">own article.</a> Each age has
it's own section, which contains multiple paragraphs. Unlike
earlier where each age had only one paragraph.</p>

<p>Since this website does not have a comment section of it's own,
I use Github issues as comment section. Each post has it's own
issue where you can share your thoughts. If you do not wish to
comment there then you can email me your comment, and I will post
on your behalf.</p>
<p>Note: I do not use platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Youtube,
Snapchat. Discord, Reddit, X(Twitter), Telegram</p>

<h3>Help Me</h3>
<p>Do you like what I do? Do you wish to financially help me? Then
please consider donating. I myself hate ads, trackers, paywalls, so
my only source of income is support from readers like you. The name
of donators will be listed here.</p>
<p>No worries if you can't help me financially. You can still show
your support by giving my projects a star on Github, connecting
with me on LinkedIn, sharing my works with others and in many other
ways.</p>

<li>UPI: Ask me for address.</li>
